      "content": "Copahue is an active <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> straddling the border between <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-chile\">Chile</a> and <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-argentina\">Argentina</a> in the southern Andes, rising to 2,953 m (9,688 ft). It is one of the most persistently active volcanoes in the Southern Andean Volcanic Arc, with 22 recorded eruptions — including multiple events in the 2010s and 2020s — making it the most frequently erupting volcano in the Chile-Argentina border region. The volcano is constructed within the 6.5 x 8.5 km Trapa-Trapa caldera, which formed between 600,000 and 400,000 years ago, near the northwestern margin of the much larger 20 x 15 km Pliocene Caviahue (Del Agrio) caldera. The eastern summit crater contains El Agrio, a briny, intensely acidic crater lake approximately 300 m wide, which serves as the source of the Rio Agrio — a river so acidified by volcanic discharge that it flows turquoise-white through a landscape scarred by sulfuric deposits. An ENE-WSW line of nine craters stretches 2 km across the summit ridge, with El Agrio being the easternmost and currently active vent. Copahue's geothermal system supports the Copahue and Caviahue hot springs resorts on the Argentine side, making it a rare example of a volcano that simultaneously threatens and sustains a local tourism economy. The volcano is part of the <a href=\"/ring-of-fire\">Ring of Fire</a>, generated by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate."
    },
    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Copahue is an elongated composite cone built along the Chile-Argentina border within a nested caldera system. The outer Caviahue (Del Agrio) caldera, measuring approximately 20 x 15 km, formed during the Pliocene and is now occupied by a scenic lake on the Argentine side. Within this, the smaller Trapa-Trapa caldera (6.5 x 8.5 km) formed between 0.6 and 0.4 million years ago, and it is on this caldera's rim that Copahue's modern cone was constructed. The elongated summit with nine aligned craters reflects the regional ENE-WSW structural trend, which controls magma ascent. The rock types — trachybasalt and tephrite basanite — are relatively alkaline and mafic compared to many subduction zone volcanoes, reflecting the unique geochemical character of this segment of the arc. The El Agrio crater lake is a window into the volcano's active hydrothermal system: its extreme acidity (pH < 1 in some measurements), high temperatures, and dissolved sulfur content reflect continuous input of volcanic gases from a shallow magmatic source. Below the crater lake's eastern outlet, acidic hot springs feed into the Rio Agrio, creating one of the most volcanically influenced river systems in South America."

    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "Copahue's 22 recorded eruptions span from approximately 6820 BCE to October 2024. Historical activity begins around 1750, with subsequent eruptions in 1867, 1937, 1944, 1960, and 1961. The volcano entered a notably active phase beginning in 1992 that has continued into the 2020s, with eruptions in 1992-1993, 1994, 1995, 2000, 2012 (two events), 2012-2013, 2014, 2015-2017, 2017-2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2024. All recorded eruptions have been rated <a href=\"/volcanic-explosivity-index\">VEI</a> 0-2 — relatively mild explosive events involving ejection of pyroclastic material, chilled sulfur fragments, and crater lake water. The volcano's eruption style is dominated by phreatic and phreatomagmatic explosions through the crater lake."

          "content": "The eruption of July 1, 2000 was one of Copahue's more significant recent events, involving explosive activity through the El Agrio crater lake that ejected pyroclastic rocks, hot lake water, and chilled liquid sulfur fragments — the latter being a distinctive and scientifically notable feature of eruptions at hyper-acidic crater lake volcanoes. The ejection of the crater lake generated lahars and acidic floods down the Rio Agrio drainage. The eruption prompted evacuation alerts for the Caviahue community. The event demonstrated the specific hazard posed by crater lake volcanoes: even modest explosive events can generate disproportionately large and hazardous lahars when crater lake water is violently expelled."

Activity beginning on July 17, 2012 (VEI 2) from El Agrio Crater was followed by renewed and more sustained activity from December 22, 2012 through 2013 (VEI 2). Both events involved explosive activity through the crater lake, ash emissions reaching several kilometers above the summit, and increased seismic activity. Chile raised the alert level to Red (the highest) in December 2012, and Argentine authorities ordered evacuations of Caviahue and nearby areas. The 2012-2013 episode marked the beginning of Copahue's most active modern period."

SERNAGEOMIN (Chile) and the Argentine geological survey jointly monitor the volcano using seismic networks, gas measurement stations, webcams, and satellite observations. The crater lake's temperature, chemistry, and level are tracked as sensitive indicators of magmatic unrest — rising temperatures and increasing acidity often precede explosive activity. Since 1992, the volcano has averaged roughly one eruptive episode every 1-2 years, maintaining a state of near-persistent low-level unrest."

    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "Copahue's principal hazards include phreatic and phreatomagmatic explosions ejecting ballistic projectiles and crater lake water, lahars generated by explosive ejection of the El Agrio crater lake, ashfall on the Argentine side (prevailing winds carry tephra eastward), and acidic floods along the Rio Agrio. The town of Caviahue (~600 permanent residents, swelling to several thousand during ski and hot springs seasons) lies approximately 7 km northeast within the Caviahue caldera and is the primary community at risk. While Copahue's eruptions have historically been VEI 0-2, the presence of the crater lake amplifies lahar hazards. Chile's SERNAGEOMIN and Argentine authorities maintain evacuation protocols for Caviahue."

    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "Copahue is an elongated composite cone with a 2-km-long summit ridge aligned ENE-WSW, punctuated by nine craters of varying size and age. The eastern summit crater contains the El Agrio crater lake — a vivid, milky turquoise pool approximately 300 m wide, surrounded by fumarolic vents emitting sulfurous gases and encrusted with bright yellow sulfur deposits. The volcano straddles the continental divide: the western slopes drain into Chile, while the eastern slopes feed the Rio Agrio, which flows through the Caviahue caldera into the scenic Lago Caviahue on the Argentine side. A ski resort operates on Copahue's lower eastern slopes — one of the few active volcanoes in the world with a ski area on its flanks."
    },
    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "Copahue is named from the Mapuche word meaning 'place of sulfur,' reflecting the indigenous Mapuche people's long awareness of the volcano's geothermal features. The Copahue and Caviahue hot springs have been used therapeutically for centuries, and the modern resort town offers thermal baths, mud treatments, and other balneotherapy experiences drawing on the volcano's geothermal output. The relationship between the community and the volcano exemplifies the dual nature of volcanism: the same geothermal system that drives eruptions also supports the local economy through tourism."
    },
    "visiting_and_tourism": {
      "content": "The Copahue-Caviahue area is a popular tourist destination in the Argentine province of Neuquen, offering hot springs, skiing, hiking, and volcanic landscapes. The Copahue thermal baths complex provides therapeutic bathing in naturally heated, mineral-rich waters fed by the volcano's geothermal system. In winter, the Caviahue ski resort operates on the volcano's lower slopes. Summer hiking trails lead to the crater rim, where visitors can view the El Agrio crater lake, though access may be restricted during periods of elevated volcanic activity. The town of Caviahue serves as the tourism base. Visitors should check volcanic alert levels before planning trips, as eruptions can prompt closures and evacuations with little warning."
