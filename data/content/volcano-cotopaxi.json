      "content": "Cotopaxi is an active <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> in the Andes of central <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-ecuador\">Ecuador</a>, rising to 5,911 m (19,393 ft) above sea level approximately 50 km (31 mi) south of the capital city of Quito. It is one of the highest active volcanoes in the world — the highest in Ecuador and among the highest in the entire <a href=\"/ring-of-fire\">Ring of Fire</a> — and has one of the longest and most violent eruption records of any Andean volcano, with 86 confirmed eruptions spanning nearly 10,000 years. Cotopaxi's near-perfect symmetrical cone, capped by a glacier that gleams white against the equatorial sky, has made it an iconic symbol of Ecuador and one of the most recognizable volcanic profiles on Earth.\n\nThe volcano sits on the Northern Andean Volcanic Arc, generated by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate at approximately 6–7 cm per year. This tectonic engine produces the volatile-rich andesitic magmas responsible for Cotopaxi's explosively violent eruption style. What makes Cotopaxi exceptionally dangerous is the combination of this explosivity with a substantial glacial ice cap covering approximately 14 km² of the summit. When hot pyroclastic material meets glacial ice, the result is catastrophic lahars — volcanic mudflows of devastating volume and speed. In the 1877 VEI 4 eruption, pyroclastic flows melted summit glaciers and generated lahars that traveled over 100 km, reaching the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Amazon basin to the east. Approximately 300,000 people now live in Cotopaxi's lahar hazard zones, including parts of greater Quito, making it one of the most consequential volcanic threats in the Americas alongside <a href=\"/volcano/popocatepetl\">Popocatépetl</a> and <a href=\"/volcano/rainier\">Mount Rainier</a>. Cotopaxi most recently erupted in October 2022, with activity continuing into early 2023, maintaining its status as one of the most persistently active volcanoes on the continent."

    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Cotopaxi's geological history reflects a dynamic and often destructive evolution typical of large Andean stratovolcanoes built above continental subduction zones. The modern edifice has been constructed since a major sector collapse sometime prior to approximately 5,000 years ago, meaning the impressive symmetrical cone visible today is geologically young. Before this collapse, an older Cotopaxi edifice had grown over tens of thousands of years through the accumulation of alternating layers of andesitic lava flows, pyroclastic deposits, and lahar sediments — the classic <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">composite volcano</a> architecture.\n\nThe volcano rises from the Inter-Andean Valley (or 'Avenue of the Volcanoes,' as Alexander von Humboldt named the corridor of Ecuadorian volcanoes in 1802) at a base elevation of approximately 3,800 m. The steep-sided cone, built of andesitic to basaltic andesitic lavas and pyroclastic deposits, maintains remarkably uniform slopes of approximately 30–35° from base to the glacier-covered summit. Deep valleys scoured by repeated lahars radiate from the summit in all directions, providing channels that funnel future lahars toward populated lowlands.\n\nThe summit hosts nested craters, the largest approximately 550 × 800 m in diameter, often obscured by the glacier cap. Cotopaxi's magmas are dominantly andesitic to basaltic andesitic in composition — intermediate in silica content — which produces eruptions that can range from relatively fluid lava effusion to violently explosive Plinian columns depending on magma volatile content and ascent rate. The volcano's position within the broader Northern Volcanic Zone of the Andes places it among dozens of active volcanoes from Colombia through Ecuador, including neighbors Tungurahua, Chimborazo (an extinct volcano that is the farthest point from Earth's center), Reventador, and Sangay. The subduction of the Carnegie Ridge — an oceanic plateau on the Nazca Plate — beneath Ecuador is thought to influence the region's particularly intense and explosive volcanism."

    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "Cotopaxi's 86 confirmed eruptions make it one of the most prolific volcanoes in the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Program database and the most frequently erupting major stratovolcano in South America. The eruption record extends back to approximately 7690 BCE, though the geological record of older events is undoubtedly incomplete. Seven eruptions reached VEI 5 during the prehistoric period (between approximately 5820 and 1130 BCE), demonstrating that Cotopaxi is capable of enormous explosive violence exceeding anything observed in its historical record.\n\nHistorical eruptions, documented since the Spanish colonial period beginning with the 1532–1534 eruption sequence witnessed by conquistadors, reveal an extraordinarily active volcano. The 18th and 19th centuries were periods of particularly intense activity: between 1742 and 1907, Cotopaxi erupted at least 40 times, averaging one eruption every four years during some decades. The three most devastating historical eruptions — 1744 (VEI 4), 1768 (VEI 4), and 1877 (VEI 4) — each generated catastrophic pyroclastic flows and lahars. After a relatively quiet period from the early 20th century through 2014, Cotopaxi reawakened with eruptions in 2015–2016 and 2022–2023, both VEI 2 events that served as powerful reminders of the ongoing threat to Ecuador's population.\n\nThe eruption frequency data shows a clear pattern: Cotopaxi undergoes decades-long periods of high activity separated by quiet intervals. The current period of renewed unrest, beginning in 2015, may represent the opening of a new active phase — though whether it will escalate to the intensity of the 18th–19th century episodes remains the central question for hazard planners."

          "content": "The eruption of May 1744 was one of Cotopaxi's most destructive historical events, rated VEI 4. Pyroclastic flows descended all flanks of the volcano and melted substantial portions of the glacier cap, generating massive lahars that swept down the radial valleys surrounding the cone. The lahars devastated the town of Latacunga and surrounding agricultural communities in the Inter-Andean Valley, killing hundreds of people and destroying infrastructure. The 1744 eruption established the template of destruction that would repeat in 1768 and 1877: explosive summit eruptions, pyroclastic flow-glacier interaction, and catastrophic lahars reaching populated valleys far from the volcano. Colonial Spanish accounts describe rivers of mud carrying enormous boulders through populated areas with little warning."

The eruption was documented by colonial officials and by the La Condamine geodesic expedition scientists who were working in the region. Heavy ashfall blanketed the Inter-Andean Valley, collapsing roofs and destroying crops across a wide area. Lahars again devastated the drainage systems radiating from Cotopaxi, reaching the Pacific coastal lowlands. The 1768 eruption was notable for the intensity of its explosive phase, with descriptions of a sustained eruption column, continuous cannon-like detonations heard hundreds of kilometers away, and darkness that lasted for days in nearby towns under thick ash cover."

          "title": "The 1877 Eruption — Lahars to the Pacific and the Amazon",
          "content": "The eruption of June 26, 1877, is Cotopaxi's most famous historical event and one of the most studied lahar-generating eruptions in volcanological literature. Rated VEI 4, the eruption began with a powerful explosive phase that sent pyroclastic flows cascading down all flanks of the volcano. When these flows — superheated mixtures of gas, ash, and rock traveling at hundreds of kilometers per hour — struck the summit glaciers, they generated lahars of extraordinary volume and reach.\n\nThe lahars traveled with devastating speed through valleys radiating outward from the volcano. To the north, lahars swept down the Río Pita valley toward what are now the southern suburbs of Quito, traveling approximately 50 km. To the south, lahars destroyed the town of Latacunga for the third time in 133 years, continuing down the Río Cutuchi for over 100 km. Most remarkably, lahars reached both the Pacific Ocean (traveling west through the Río Esmeraldas drainage, a distance of over 300 km from the summit) and the western Amazon basin (traveling east through the Río Napo drainage), demonstrating that Cotopaxi's lahar threat extends across an enormous geographic footprint.\n\nThe death toll from the 1877 lahars, while not precisely documented, is estimated in the hundreds to low thousands. The lahars arrived in populated areas with terrifying speed — contemporary accounts describe intervals of only 30 minutes to a few hours between the eruption onset and lahar arrival in towns tens of kilometers distant. The 1877 eruption remains the primary reference scenario for modern lahar hazard planning around Cotopaxi, and the lahar pathways mapped from this event form the basis of current evacuation zone delineations."

The eruption, rated VEI 2, continued intermittently through early 2016 with periodic ash emissions, elevated sulfur dioxide output, and elevated seismicity.\n\nThe 2015 eruption triggered immediate alarm across Ecuador and drew global attention. Cotopaxi National Park was closed, evacuation plans were activated for communities in lahar hazard zones, and the Ecuadorian government declared states of emergency in multiple provinces. The eruption was modest in scale — no significant pyroclastic flows or lahars were generated — but it served as a wake-up call that Cotopaxi's long repose was ending."

Activity continued into January 2023 at VEI 2 intensity, with intermittent ash emissions reaching several kilometers above the summit and light ashfall affecting communities downwind. The eruption prompted renewed closures of Cotopaxi National Park and elevated monitoring protocols. While the 2022–2023 activity remained at low explosive levels, it reinforced concerns that Cotopaxi may be entering a new period of sustained unrest. Volcanologists at the IG-EPN continue to closely monitor seismic activity, ground deformation, and gas emissions for signs of escalation."

    "current_status_and_monitoring": {
      "content": "Cotopaxi is classified as active with an elevated baseline of unrest following the 2015–2016 and 2022–2023 eruptions. The volcano is monitored by Ecuador's Instituto Geofísico de la Escuela Politécnica Nacional (IG-EPN), which operates one of the most comprehensive volcano monitoring networks in Latin America. The monitoring system includes a dense network of broadband seismometers on and around the edifice, continuous GPS stations measuring ground deformation, infrasound sensors detecting atmospheric pressure waves from explosions, gas monitoring stations (SO₂ flux, CO₂ concentrations), webcams providing visual surveillance, and periodic satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) for tracking millimeter-scale surface deformation.\n\nAs of early 2025, Cotopaxi continues to exhibit low-level unrest including minor seismicity, degassing, and thermal anomalies within the summit crater. The IG-EPN maintains a daily reporting schedule and issues alerts through a color-coded system communicated to civil protection authorities and the public. Ecuador has invested significantly in lahar early warning systems along the primary drainage channels — automated detection stations can sense lahars in upstream valleys and trigger sirens in downstream communities, providing critical minutes of warning for evacuation.\n\nThe central monitoring question is whether the current unrest cycle will escalate to a larger eruption. Historical precedent offers mixed signals: Cotopaxi has transitioned from minor activity to major VEI 4 eruptions rapidly in the past (as in the 1740s sequence), but it has also produced years of minor activity that did not escalate. Scientists emphasize that the presence of a ~14 km² glacier cap on the summit means that even a moderate eruption could generate dangerous lahars — a scenario that keeps Cotopaxi among the most closely watched volcanoes in the Western Hemisphere."
    },
    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "Cotopaxi presents one of the most severe volcanic lahar threats in the world. The hazard is driven by the volcano's demonstrated ability to generate large pyroclastic flows that interact with summit glaciers to produce lahars of extraordinary volume, speed, and reach. Lahar hazard maps based on the 1877 eruption scenario show that flows could reach the southern outskirts of Quito (population ~2.8 million) via the Río Pita drainage in as little as 30–45 minutes, and Latacunga (population ~100,000) to the south in similar timeframes.\n\nThe primary hazard types from Cotopaxi include lahars (the dominant threat — volcanic mudflows generated by pyroclastic flow-glacier interaction), pyroclastic flows (direct hazard within ~15 km of summit), tephra fall (ashfall disrupting agriculture, water supply, and aviation across the Inter-Andean Valley), lava flows (primarily confined to the upper edifice), and sector collapse (a major edifice failure could generate debris avalanches).\n\nApproximately 300,000 people live within officially designated lahar hazard zones. The population exposure has increased dramatically since the 1877 eruption: Quito has grown from roughly 50,000 to 2.8 million, and the Valle de los Chillos — directly in the path of northern lahars — has urbanized extensively. Ecuador's national risk management system (SNGRE) maintains evacuation plans and conducts regular drills, but the logistical challenge of evacuating hundreds of thousands of people in mountainous terrain with limited road capacity is formidable. Cotopaxi's lahar threat is frequently compared to that of <a href=\"/volcano/rainier\">Mount Rainier</a> in the United States, where glacial lahars pose a similar risk to communities in Washington State — though Cotopaxi's eruption frequency is dramatically higher, and its most recent major lahar-generating eruption is far more recent (1877 vs. ~500 years ago for Rainier)."

    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "Cotopaxi presents one of the most visually striking volcanic profiles on Earth: a near-perfect symmetrical cone rising from a base elevation of approximately 3,800 m in the Inter-Andean Valley to a summit of 5,911 m (19,393 ft), entirely capped by a gleaming white glacier that extends from approximately 4,700 m to the summit. The cone's remarkably uniform slopes of 30–35° are interrupted by deep ravines — barrancas — carved by centuries of lahar flows, which radiate outward from the summit like spokes of a wheel.\n\nThe summit glacier covered approximately 14 km² as of recent measurements, though it has been retreating due to both climate change and volcanic heat. The glacier is of critical hazard significance: it provides the water source for lahar generation during eruptions. The summit crater complex consists of nested craters, the largest approximately 550 × 800 m across, usually filled with ice and snow except during and shortly after eruptions.\n\nCotopaxi sits within Cotopaxi National Park, a 33,393-hectare protected area established in 1975 at elevations between 3,400 and 5,911 m. The park encompasses paramo grasslands — the distinctive high-altitude Andean ecosystem — wild horses, and Andean condors, set against the dramatic backdrop of the volcano. Alexander von Humboldt attempted to climb Cotopaxi in 1802, reaching approximately 4,500 m, and described the 'Avenue of the Volcanoes' — the double chain of volcanic peaks flanking the Inter-Andean Valley — that makes central Ecuador one of the most volcanically dramatic landscapes on Earth."

    "climate_and_global_impact": {
      "content": "While Cotopaxi's historical eruptions have been devastating regionally, none have been large enough to produce measurable global climate effects. The largest historical eruptions (VEI 4 events in 1744, 1768, and 1877) were powerful but approximately 10–100 times smaller in ejecta volume than climate-altering eruptions like <a href=\"/volcano/tambora\">Tambora</a> in 1815 (VEI 7) or Pinatubo in 1991 (VEI 6). However, Cotopaxi's prehistoric record includes seven VEI 5 eruptions — events that, while still smaller than the great climate-modifying eruptions, would have produced significant regional ash fall and possible hemisphere-level atmospheric effects.\n\nCotopaxi's primary environmental impact is regional. Major eruptions produce heavy tephra fall that can devastate agriculture across the Inter-Andean Valley — Ecuador's most productive agricultural zone — and contaminate water supplies for millions of people. Ashfall from even moderate eruptions disrupts aviation at Quito's Mariscal Sucre International Airport, approximately 60 km to the north. A VEI 4 or larger eruption under modern conditions would produce an agricultural and economic crisis affecting Ecuador at a national scale."

    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "Cotopaxi holds a central place in Ecuadorian national identity, appearing on currency, postage stamps, and countless artistic representations. The volcano's perfectly symmetrical, glacier-capped cone rising above the equatorial highlands is arguably the most iconic natural image of Ecuador. The name 'Cotopaxi' is of uncertain Kichwa origin, most commonly interpreted as 'Neck of the Moon' (from koto = neck and paksi = moon), though alternative etymologies have been proposed.\n\nThe volcano figures prominently in the history of scientific exploration. Alexander von Humboldt's attempted ascent in 1802 — during his pioneering South American expedition — produced some of the earliest scientific observations of the volcano and helped establish the concept of ecological zonation with altitude. The first confirmed summit was achieved in 1872 by German geologist Wilhelm Reiss and Colombian botanist Ángel Escobar. In pre-Columbian Andean culture, Cotopaxi was revered and feared as a powerful deity. The eruption of November 1532 coincided almost exactly with Francisco Pizarro's arrival in Ecuador and the fall of the Inca Empire, an association that profoundly shaped colonial and indigenous narratives. Today, Cotopaxi National Park is one of Ecuador's most important protected areas and a cornerstone of the country's ecotourism economy."

    "visiting_and_tourism": {
      "content": "Cotopaxi is one of South America's most popular mountaineering and trekking destinations, drawing tens of thousands of visitors annually to Cotopaxi National Park. The park is accessible from Quito (approximately 2 hours by road via the Pan-American Highway) and from Latacunga to the south.\n\nFor non-climbers, the José Rivas refuge at 4,800 m (15,748 ft) is accessible by a 45-minute steep hike from the parking area at 4,500 m, offering spectacular views of the glacier and surrounding paramo. The Limpiopungo lagoon at the volcano's base (3,800 m) provides an easier, lower-altitude option with reflection views of the cone. Mountain biking on the volcano's lower slopes is increasingly popular.\n\nSummit climbs are serious mountaineering endeavors requiring crampons, ice axes, ropes, and experience with glacier travel. Most attempts begin at midnight from the José Rivas refuge, ascending through the night to reach the 5,911 m summit at dawn before afternoon weather and softening glacial ice increase hazard. The standard climb takes 6–8 hours ascending and 2–3 hours descending. Acclimatization at altitude (at least 2–3 days in Quito at 2,850 m) is essential. Licensed guides are required for summit attempts. Access to the park and upper slopes may be restricted during periods of volcanic unrest. The best climbing season is December–January and June–September."

    "Cotopaxi's 86 confirmed eruptions make it one of the most prolific volcanoes in the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program database and the most frequently erupting major stratovolcano in South America.",
    "The 1877 eruption generated lahars that traveled over 100 km in multiple directions, reaching both the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Amazon basin to the east — a total drainage footprint spanning nearly the entire width of Ecuador.",
    "At 5,911 m (19,393 ft), Cotopaxi is one of the highest active volcanoes in the world and the second-highest summit in Ecuador after Chimborazo (6,263 m).",
    "Approximately 300,000 people now live in Cotopaxi's officially designated lahar hazard zones, including parts of the southern metropolitan area of Quito — a population that has grown enormously since the last catastrophic lahars in 1877.",
    "Alexander von Humboldt attempted to climb Cotopaxi in 1802, reaching approximately 4,500 m; he coined the term 'Avenue of the Volcanoes' for Ecuador's Inter-Andean volcanic corridor.",
    "Cotopaxi erupted on November 15, 1532 — almost exactly coinciding with Francisco Pizarro's arrival in Ecuador and the fall of the Inca Empire.",
    "Seven of Cotopaxi's eruptions reached VEI 5 during the prehistoric period — a level of explosive violence 10 times greater than anything observed in its recorded historical eruptions.",
    "The summit glacier, covering approximately 14 km², is both an icon and a threat: it provides the water mass that, when melted by pyroclastic flows, generates Cotopaxi's catastrophic lahars.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Cotopaxi an active volcano?",
      "answer": "Yes, Cotopaxi is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. With 86 confirmed eruptions spanning nearly 10,000 years, it has one of the longest and most prolific eruption records of any stratovolcano on Earth. Cotopaxi most recently erupted from October 2022 into January 2023, preceded by an earlier eruption in 2015–2016 that ended a 73-year quiet period. The volcano is continuously monitored by Ecuador's Instituto Geofísico (IG-EPN) and currently exhibits low-level unrest including minor seismicity and degassing. Scientists consider future eruptions not just possible but probable, and Ecuador maintains active lahar early warning systems and evacuation plans for the approximately 300,000 people living in hazard zones."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did Cotopaxi last erupt?",
      "answer": "Cotopaxi's most recent eruption began on October 21, 2022, with elevated volcanic tremor and gas emissions, escalating to ash venting from the summit crater. Activity continued intermittently into January 2023 at VEI 2 (low-intensity) levels, with ash columns reaching several kilometers above the summit and light ashfall affecting downwind communities. Prior to this, Cotopaxi had erupted from August 2015 through early 2016, also at VEI 2. Both eruptions were relatively minor compared to Cotopaxi's destructive historical eruptions (VEI 4 events in 1744, 1768, and 1877), but they ended a long quiet period and demonstrated that the volcano's plumbing system remains active."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall is Cotopaxi?",
      "answer": "Cotopaxi rises to 5,911 m (19,393 ft) above sea level, making it one of the highest active volcanoes in the world and the second-highest summit in Ecuador after the extinct Chimborazo (6,263 m / 20,549 ft). The volcano's base sits at approximately 3,800 m in the Inter-Andean Valley, so the cone itself rises about 2,100 m above its surroundings. Despite its extreme altitude, Cotopaxi's near-equatorial location (0.677°S latitude) means it carries a smaller glacier than similarly elevated volcanoes at higher latitudes. The summit is covered by a glacial ice cap of approximately 14 km², which has been retreating due to climate change and volcanic heat."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you climb Cotopaxi?",
      "answer": "Yes, Cotopaxi is one of the most popular high-altitude mountaineering objectives in South America. The standard route from the José Rivas refuge at 4,800 m to the 5,911 m summit is a glacier climb requiring crampons, ice axes, ropes, and experienced guides (legally required in Ecuador). Most attempts begin around midnight, ascending through the night to summit at dawn. The climb takes approximately 6–8 hours up and 2–3 hours down. Proper acclimatization (at least 2–3 days at Quito's 2,850 m elevation) is essential. Access may be restricted during volcanic unrest — the park was closed during the 2015 and 2022–2023 eruptions. The best climbing windows are December–January and June–September."
    },
    {
      "question": "What would happen if Cotopaxi had a major eruption today?",
      "answer": "A major eruption (VEI 4, comparable to 1877) would be catastrophic for central Ecuador. Pyroclastic flows would melt portions of the summit glacier, generating massive lahars — volcanic mudflows — that would race down radial valleys at speeds exceeding 60 km/h. Lahars would reach Latacunga (30 km south, population ~100,000) in approximately 30 minutes and could extend into the southern suburbs of Quito within 45 minutes via the Río Pita drainage. Approximately 300,000 people live in lahar hazard zones. Heavy ashfall would disrupt Quito's airport, contaminate water supplies, and devastate agriculture. Ecuador has lahar early warning systems and evacuation plans, but the logistical challenges of evacuating hundreds of thousands of people in mountainous terrain would be immense."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Cotopaxi so dangerous?",
      "answer": "Cotopaxi's exceptional danger stems from a lethal combination of factors. First, it is an explosively active stratovolcano with a demonstrated history of VEI 4–5 eruptions and an eruption frequency among the highest in the world (86 eruptions in ~10,000 years). Second, its summit is capped by approximately 14 km² of glacial ice, which melts catastrophically when contacted by pyroclastic flows, generating lahars that can travel over 100 km at speeds exceeding 60 km/h. Third, approximately 300,000 people live in its lahar hazard zones, including parts of metropolitan Quito. Fourth, the mountainous terrain with limited road networks makes rapid evacuation extremely challenging. This combination of explosive activity, glacier-lahar coupling, and dense downstream population makes Cotopaxi one of the most dangerous volcanoes on the planet."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often does Cotopaxi erupt?",
      "answer": "Cotopaxi has erupted 86 times in approximately 10,000 years, averaging roughly one eruption per 115 years across its full record. However, eruptions are highly clustered in time. During the extraordinarily active 18th and 19th centuries, Cotopaxi erupted over 50 times — nearly once every three years between 1742 and 1907. The 20th century was comparatively quiet (5 eruptions, the last uncertain in 1942), followed by a 73-year pause before the 2015 reawakening. The current pattern of renewed unrest (eruptions in 2015 and 2022) may signal the beginning of a new active period, though whether it will approach the intensity of the 1800s remains uncertain."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the closest city to Cotopaxi?",
      "answer": "The closest significant city to Cotopaxi is Latacunga, the capital of Cotopaxi Province, located approximately 30 km (19 mi) north-northwest of the summit with a population of roughly 100,000. Latacunga sits directly in the path of lahars flowing northward from the volcano and has been destroyed by Cotopaxi lahars three times in recorded history (1744, 1768, and 1877). The national capital, Quito (population ~2.8 million), is approximately 50 km (31 mi) to the north, with its southern suburbs extending into lahar hazard zones via the Río Pita valley."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the name Cotopaxi mean?",
      "answer": "The name 'Cotopaxi' comes from the Kichwa (Quechua) language, though its exact meaning is debated among linguists and historians. The most widely accepted interpretation is 'Neck of the Moon,' derived from koto (neck or throat) and paksi (moon), possibly describing how moonlight illuminates the glacier-capped summit. Other proposed translations include 'Shining Peak' and 'Smooth Neck of Silver.' The name was recorded in various spellings by Spanish colonial chroniclers and was standardized in its current form largely through Alexander von Humboldt's influential 1802 accounts of his South American expeditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Cotopaxi the tallest active volcano in the world?",
      "answer": "No, but Cotopaxi is among the tallest. At 5,911 m (19,393 ft), it ranks as one of the highest active volcanoes on Earth, but the title of tallest active volcano belongs to Ojos del Salado on the Chile-Argentina border at 6,893 m (22,615 ft) — though its last eruption was approximately 1,000–1,500 years ago and its 'active' status is debated. Llullaillaco (6,739 m), also on the Chile-Argentina border, last erupted in 1877. Among unambiguously active volcanoes with eruptions in the past century, Cotopaxi is indeed one of the very highest, rivaled by Popocatépetl in Mexico at 5,393 m."
