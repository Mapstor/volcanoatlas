    "overview": {
      "content": "Nevados de Chillán is one of the most active volcanic complexes in the Central Andes of <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-chile\">Chile</a>, consisting of three late-Pleistocene to Holocene <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcanoes</a> constructed along a NNW–SSE alignment within three nested Pleistocene calderas. The complex reaches a maximum elevation of 3,180 m (10,433 ft) and has produced 32 recorded eruptions spanning nearly 9,000 years, from approximately 6890 BCE to a sustained eruption from 2016 to 2022. The compound structure includes several distinct volcanic centers that have migrated over time: the dominantly andesitic Cerro Blanco (Volcán Nevado) at the northwestern end, Volcán Viejo (Volcán Chillán) at the southeastern end — the main active vent from the 17th through 19th centuries — and the younger Volcán Nuevo lava-dome complex that formed between 1906 and 1945. Subsequently, the Volcán Arrau dome complex grew between 1973 and 1986. Most recently, the Nicanor crater became the active vent during the 2016–2022 eruption. This pattern of sequential vent migration is characteristic of complex volcanic systems. Nevados de Chillán is uniquely notable for hosting a major ski resort on its slopes, drawing thousands of visitors to runs on the flanks of a volcano that was actively erupting as recently as 2022. The complex lies within the <a href=\"/ring-of-fire\">Southern Andean Volcanic Arc</a>, generated by the eastward subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate."
    },
    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Nevados de Chillán lies within the Southern Andean Volcanic Zone (SVZ), where the Nazca Plate subducts eastward beneath the South American Plate at a rate of approximately 6.5 cm per year. The volcanic complex is built on thick continental crust exceeding 25 km, and its andesitic to basaltic-andesitic composition is typical of Andean arc volcanism. The three nested Pleistocene calderas that contain the Holocene cones are remnants of much larger explosive eruptions that produced ignimbrite sheets extending more than 100 km into Chile's Central Depression — testimony to VEI 6–7 scale events in the distant past. The current volcanic complex is aligned along a NNW–SSE structural trend that controls the sequential migration of active vents. Cerro Blanco at the northwest end is the oldest Holocene edifice, while Volcán Viejo at the southeast end became dominant during historical times. The 20th-century growth of Volcán Nuevo (1906–1945) and Volcán Arrau (1973–1986) as lava domes on Viejo's flanks represents a progressive migration of the active vent system. The complex's dome-building behavior reflects the intermediate silica content of the magma — viscous enough to form lava domes rather than fluid flows, but not so silicic as to produce the catastrophic dome collapses seen at more silicic volcanoes like <a href=\"/volcano/pelee\">Mount Pelée</a>."

    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "Nevados de Chillán's 32 recorded eruptions span approximately 9,000 years, beginning with Holocene eruptions at Volcán Viejo around 6890 BCE and continuing through the sustained 2016–2022 eruption at the Nicanor crater. The eruption record shows a clear migration of activity between vents. Prehistoric eruptions (6890 BCE through 320 BCE) are documented from Volcán Viejo. Historical activity at Viejo spans from 1650 through the late 19th century, with eruptions reaching <a href=\"/volcanic-explosivity-index\">VEI</a> 3 in 1650, 1749–1751, and 1864–1865. Activity shifted to Volcán Nuevo in the early 20th century with a prolonged dome-building eruption from 1906 to 1945, followed by further Nuevo eruptions in 1946–1947. The Volcán Arrau dome complex then grew during a sustained eruption from 1973 to 1986 (VEI 2), eventually exceeding Nuevo's height. After a relatively quiet period, activity resumed in 2003 and 2009 before the major 2016–2022 eruption established the Nicanor crater as the newest active vent."

This dome, which would become known as Volcán Nuevo, continued to grow intermittently for nearly four decades until approximately 1945. The eruption was predominantly effusive, with viscous andesitic lava slowly extruding to build the dome complex, punctuated by explosive episodes that generated ash columns and pyroclastic flows. The creation of an entirely new volcanic edifice over a 39-year period was a remarkable demonstration of sustained volcanic activity, and Volcán Nuevo eventually became a prominent feature of the complex's skyline."

This 13-year eruption at VEI 2 represented another major vent migration event, with the active center shifting from Nuevo's summit to its southeastern side. Volcán Arrau eventually exceeded the height of Volcán Nuevo, demonstrating the ongoing southeastward migration of activity.

This eruption continued for approximately six years until 2022 at VEI 2, making it one of the longest-sustained eruptive episodes at the complex since the 1906–1945 Volcán Nuevo event. Activity included Vulcanian explosions, intermittent ash emissions, dome growth within the crater, pyroclastic flows generated by dome collapse, and lava flow effusion. SERNAGEOMIN, Chile's geological survey, maintained elevated alert levels throughout much of this period, and the eruption attracted significant scientific attention as researchers studied dome dynamics and gas emissions. The eruption periodically disrupted operations at the nearby Nevados de Chillán ski resort and forced evacuations of rural communities on the volcano's flanks. The establishment of the Nicanor crater as the newest active vent confirmed the continued southeastward migration of the volcanic focus."

      "content": "Nevados de Chillán has been relatively quiet since the 2016–2022 eruption ended, though fumarolic emissions and minor seismicity continue at the Nicanor crater. SERNAGEOMIN operates a comprehensive monitoring network including broadband seismometers, infrasound sensors, continuous GPS stations, sulfur dioxide flux measurements (DOAS), thermal cameras, and webcams. The volcano's alert level has been reduced from the higher levels maintained during the 2016–2022 eruption but remains above baseline. Given the complex's history of prolonged eruptive episodes followed by relatively brief pauses before activity resumes, volcanologists consider a return to eruption possible. The ski resort on the northwestern flank continues to operate during quiet periods, with SERNAGEOMIN advisories informing operational decisions."

    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "Nevados de Chillán's primary hazards include pyroclastic flows generated by dome collapse (the most dangerous near-vent hazard), lava flows, ashfall, ballistic projectiles, and lahars. The compound nature of the complex, with multiple potential vent locations along the NNW–SSE axis, complicates hazard mapping because eruptions can originate from different parts of the system. Pyroclastic flows from dome collapses can travel rapidly down the steep Andean valleys radiating from the complex, threatening the rural communities and infrastructure in these drainages. Lahars generated by eruption-triggered snowmelt — given the volcano's high elevation and seasonal snow/glacier cover — represent a significant secondary hazard, potentially affecting areas well beyond the immediate volcanic zone. The Nevados de Chillán ski resort on the northwestern flank lies within the potential hazard zone for certain eruption scenarios, creating a unique risk management challenge. The city of Chillán (population approximately 180,000), located about 50 km to the northwest, is beyond the reach of most direct volcanic hazards but could experience ashfall during larger eruptions. SERNAGEOMIN has developed detailed hazard maps and maintains evacuation plans for communities within the defined hazard zones."
    },
    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "The Nevados de Chillán complex occupies a rugged section of the Chilean Andes at approximately 36.9°S latitude. The massif extends roughly 10 km along its NNW–SSE axis, with multiple summits exceeding 3,000 m. The northwestern end is anchored by Cerro Blanco (Volcán Nevado), while the southeastern end is dominated by Volcán Viejo. Between them, the younger dome complexes of Volcán Nuevo, Volcán Arrau, and the Nicanor crater create a crowded volcanic landscape. The upper slopes carry seasonal snow and small glaciers, giving the complex its name (“nevados” meaning snowy or snow-capped). Deep valleys radiate from the massif, carved by rivers, glacial erosion, and volcanic processes. The surrounding landscape transitions from alpine terrain near the summit to native Araucaria (monkey puzzle) forests and agricultural land at lower elevations. The Nevados de Chillán ski resort occupies the northwestern flank, with lifts and runs situated on the volcano's slopes."

    "climate_and_global_impact": {
      "content": "Nevados de Chillán's eruptions have been too small to produce measurable global climate effects. The largest recorded events at VEI 3 injected insufficient material into the stratosphere for hemispheric temperature impacts. The primary atmospheric effects have been regional ashfall and sulfur dioxide emissions affecting local air quality during active eruption phases. Compared to Chile's larger volcanic systems — such as <a href=\"/volcano/villarrica\">Villarrica</a>, <a href=\"/volcano/llaima\">Llaima</a>, or the historically catastrophic <a href=\"/volcano/calbuco\">Calbuco</a> — Nevados de Chillán's eruptions have been relatively modest in scale but remarkable for their duration."

    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "Nevados de Chillán is culturally significant as both a natural landmark and an economic asset for the Ñuble Region of Chile. The Nevados de Chillán ski resort, one of the premier winter sports destinations in South America, draws tens of thousands of Chilean and international visitors annually. The juxtaposition of an active volcano and a luxury ski resort creates a unique tourism identity — few other resorts in the world operate on the flanks of a volcano that erupted as recently as 2022. The surrounding thermal springs (Termas de Chillán), fed by the volcano's geothermal system, have been used for bathing and therapeutic purposes since pre-Columbian times and were known to the Mapuche people. The broader Chillán area is also significant as the birthplace of Bernardo O'Higgins, Chile's independence hero. The Ñuble National Reserve, bordering the volcanic complex, protects native Araucaria forests and Andean biodiversity."
    },
    "visiting_and_tourism": {
      "content": "Nevados de Chillán is one of the most accessible active volcanoes in Chile, thanks primarily to the Nevados de Chillán ski resort on the northwestern flank. The resort operates during the Southern Hemisphere winter (June–October), offering skiing, snowboarding, and thermal hot spring facilities. During summer months, the area supports hiking, mountain biking, and visits to the hot springs. The resort is accessible by road from Chillán city, approximately 80 km and 1.5–2 hours by car. Accommodations range from resort hotels to mountain lodges. Visitors should be aware of volcanic hazard advisories — during the 2016–2022 eruption, certain areas were restricted and the resort periodically adjusted operations. SERNAGEOMIN hazard alerts are published online and should be checked before visiting. The Ñuble National Reserve offers additional trekking opportunities in the native Araucaria forests surrounding the volcanic complex."

To the south, <a href=\"/volcano/llaima\">Llaima</a> and <a href=\"/volcano/villarrica\">Villarrica</a> are among Chile's most active and famous volcanoes. Antuco, approximately 70 km to the south, is another historically active Andean stratovolcano. The Laguna del Maule volcanic field to the north has attracted attention for significant ongoing ground uplift. The dense concentration of active volcanoes in this segment of the Andes reflects the vigorous subduction of the Nazca Plate and makes south-central Chile one of the most volcanically active regions in the Americas."
    },
    "etymology": {
      "content": "The name Nevados de Chillán translates from Spanish as “Snow-capped (peaks) of Chillán,” referring to the seasonal snow and ice cover on the volcanic summits. “Chillán” itself derives from the Mapuche language; its most commonly cited meaning is “place of the sun” or “sunlit one,” though alternative etymologies exist. The individual volcanic cones carry descriptive Spanish names: Cerro Blanco (“White Hill”), Volcán Viejo (“Old Volcano”), Volcán Nuevo (“New Volcano”), and Volcán Arrau (named after Chilean scientist)."

      "answer": "The progressive migration of active vents along the NNW–SSE axis of the Nevados de Chillán complex is driven by the evolution of the volcanic plumbing system along a structural lineament. As magma pathways become blocked by solidified lava domes or altered rock, the rising magma finds new pathways along the structural trend, opening vents at new locations. This has produced a sequential chain of volcanic centers: from Cerro Blanco and Volcán Viejo to Volcán Nuevo, Volcán Arrau, and most recently the Nicanor crater. This behavior is common at compound volcanic complexes worldwide."

      "question": "Where is Nevados de Chillán located?",
      "answer": "Nevados de Chillán is located in the Ñuble Region of south-central Chile, in the Andes Mountains near the border with Argentina, at coordinates 36.868°S, 71.378°W. The complex lies approximately 50 km southeast of the city of Chillán (population ~180,000). It is part of the Southern Andean Volcanic Zone, which extends from central Chile to Patagonia and hosts some of South America's most active volcanoes."
