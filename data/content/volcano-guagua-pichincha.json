      "content": "Guagua Pichincha is an active <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> rising to 4,784 m (15,696 ft) in the Western Cordillera of the <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-ecuador\">Ecuadorian</a> Andes, located immediately west of Quito, the nation's capital and a metropolitan area of approximately 2.8 million people. Together with the older, eroded Rucu Pichincha (4,698 m), it forms the Pichincha volcanic massif — a dominant feature of the Quito skyline visible from virtually every neighborhood in the city. Guagua Pichincha is among the most dangerous volcanoes in South America, not because of extraordinarily powerful eruptions, but because of its extreme proximity to a major population center: the active crater lies just 10 km from Quito's western suburbs.\n\nThe volcano sits within the Northern Volcanic Zone of the Andes, generated by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate at a rate of approximately 58 mm per year. With 44 recorded eruptions spanning at least 9,000 years, Guagua Pichincha has a well-documented pattern of behavior: prolonged periods of quiescence interrupted by episodes of lava dome growth followed by explosive dome destruction, which can generate dangerous pyroclastic flows down the volcano's western flanks and blanket Quito in volcanic ash. The most recent significant eruption occurred in 1999–2001, when a series of explosions and dome collapses sent ash columns over the capital, forced partial evacuations, and shut down Quito's international airport multiple times. The volcano is continuously monitored by the Instituto Geofísico of the Escuela Politécnica Nacional (IG-EPN), which operates one of the most advanced volcano monitoring networks in Latin America. Guagua Pichincha's combination of frequent eruptive activity, dome-building behavior, and immediate adjacency to a major capital city make it a focal point of volcanic risk research in the <a href=\"/ring-of-fire\">Ring of Fire</a>."
    },
    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "The Pichincha volcanic massif has a complex geological history extending back several hundred thousand years. Rucu Pichincha, the older eastern edifice, is a deeply eroded Pleistocene stratovolcano that is now considered extinct. Guagua Pichincha — whose name means 'baby' or 'child' in Quechua, reflecting its status as the younger of the two peaks — grew on the western flank of the massif and has been the source of all Holocene and historical activity.\n\nApproximately 50,000 years ago, a catastrophic lateral collapse — similar in mechanism to the 1980 collapse of <a href=\"/volcano/st-helens\">Mount St. Helens</a> — destroyed the western flank of the ancestral Guagua Pichincha edifice, creating a 6-km-wide horseshoe-shaped amphitheater (caldera de avalancha) open to the west. The resulting debris avalanche deposited enormous volumes of volcanic material across the western lowlands. Since that collapse, repeated eruptions have built a series of lava domes within the amphitheater, which grow incrementally before being destroyed by explosive eruptions — a cycle that has repeated numerous times throughout the Holocene.\n\nThe volcano's eruptive products are predominantly andesitic to basaltic-andesitic in composition, typical of subduction zone stratovolcanoes. The relatively viscous andesitic magma is responsible for the dome-building eruption style: magma rises slowly into the crater, solidifying into a plug-like dome that gradually pressurizes until explosive failure occurs. This eruption style produces pyroclastic flows (fast-moving currents of hot gas and rock) that are channeled westward through the amphitheater — away from Quito — and tephra fall (ash) that prevailing winds carry eastward over the city. The Pichincha massif rests on thick continental crust (>25 km) of the Northern Andes, and its magma is generated by the dehydration and partial melting of the subducting Nazca Plate approximately 100–150 km beneath the surface."
    },
    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "Guagua Pichincha's eruptive record includes 44 documented eruptions spanning at least 9,000 years. The prehistoric record contains several large eruptions, including a VEI 4 event around 70 CE and a VEI 5 eruption around 930 CE — the largest known Holocene eruption of the volcano. Historical eruptions have been documented since the arrival of the Spanish in the 1530s, with a notable cluster of activity in the 16th century (at least 11 eruptions between 1533 and 1600) followed by a major eruption in 1660, a quiet period of nearly two centuries, and then renewed activity in the 19th century.\n\nThe modern eruptive period began in 1981, when phreatic explosions and dome growth resumed after a century of quiet. Activity intensified through the 1990s, culminating in the 1999–2001 eruption crisis that brought international attention to the volcano's threat to Quito. Minor activity continued through 2009, with uncertain eruptions reported as recently as that year. The volcano has been relatively quiet since, though elevated fumarolic activity and occasional seismic swarms remind scientists that the current repose is likely temporary. The historical pattern suggests eruption intervals of decades to centuries, with each active period involving dome growth, explosive dome destruction, and associated ashfall."

          "content": "The most powerful known eruption of Guagua Pichincha occurred around 930 CE, reaching an estimated VEI 5 — comparable in scale to the 1980 eruption of <a href=\"/volcano/st-helens\">Mount St. Helens</a>. This eruption produced extensive pyroclastic flows that swept through the western amphitheater and far down the Pacific-facing slopes, along with a massive tephra column that deposited thick ash layers across the Inter-Andean Valley. Geological studies of the deposits indicate that the eruption involved catastrophic destruction of a pre-existing lava dome, followed by sustained explosive activity. Had Quito existed at its current scale, this eruption would have buried the city under centimeters to tens of centimeters of ash and potentially exposed the western outskirts to pyroclastic surge hazards. The 930 CE event serves as a critical benchmark for hazard planning: it represents the plausible worst-case scenario that volcanologists use to model potential future eruptions."

          "content": "The 1660 eruption was the most significant historical eruption of Guagua Pichincha and one of the best-documented volcanic events in colonial South American history. Rated VEI 4, the eruption sent an enormous ash column high into the atmosphere, depositing up to 30 cm (12 inches) of ash on Quito — transforming day into darkness for several hours and causing widespread panic among the city's colonial population of approximately 25,000. Pyroclastic flows descended the western slopes, devastating agricultural areas. Ash reportedly fell over a radius of 1,000 km. Contemporary Spanish chronicles described roofs collapsing under the weight of ash, crops destroyed, livestock killed, and religious processions organized to appeal for divine intervention. The eruption involved the explosive destruction of a lava dome that had been growing in the crater, followed by sustained Vulcanian to sub-Plinian explosions. The 1660 eruption remains the reference event for ash-hazard planning in modern Quito."

          "title": "The 1999–2001 Eruption — Crisis in Quito",
          "content": "The most recent major eruption of Guagua Pichincha began in 1998 with increasing phreatic (steam-driven) explosions and escalated dramatically in 1999. On October 5, 1999, a powerful Vulcanian explosion sent an ash column 15–20 km into the atmosphere and deposited several millimeters of fine ash across Quito, triggering panic, school closures, and the shutdown of Mariscal Sucre International Airport. A state of emergency was declared, and partial evacuations of western neighborhoods were ordered. Over the following months, additional explosions occurred, including events on October 7 and November 26, each depositing ash on the capital. The eruption involved the growth of a new lava dome within the amphitheater crater, punctuated by explosive episodes when accumulated gas pressure exceeded the dome's structural integrity.\n\nThe 1999 crisis was a watershed event for volcanic risk management in Ecuador. The IG-EPN's monitoring network, already one of the most advanced in South America, was dramatically expanded. The eruption prompted the development of comprehensive ash-hazard maps for Quito, the establishment of early warning systems, and extensive public education campaigns. While no deaths were directly attributed to the eruption, economic losses from airport closures, crop damage, and business disruption were estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. Low-level dome growth and minor explosions continued through 2001, with the last confirmed eruption in 2002 (VEI 1). The dome built during this period remains within the crater and would be the likely focus of any future eruption."

    "current_status_and_monitoring": {
      "content": "Guagua Pichincha has been relatively quiet since the 2001–2002 eruptive period, though it remains classified as active and is considered one of the highest-risk volcanoes in South America. The lava dome emplaced during the 1999–2001 eruption sits within the western amphitheater crater and continues to emit fumarolic gases, confirming ongoing magmatic heat input. Periodic seismic swarms — clusters of small earthquakes beneath the volcano — have been detected by the IG-EPN monitoring network, indicating continued magma movement or hydrothermal pressurization at depth.\n\nThe Instituto Geofísico of the Escuela Politécnica Nacional (IG-EPN) operates a comprehensive monitoring system including broadband seismometers, GPS ground deformation sensors, gas spectrometers (measuring SO₂ and CO₂ emissions), thermal cameras, and acoustic sensors. The observatory also maintains a network of webcams and issues daily volcanic activity bulletins. Quito's volcanic contingency plans, developed in the aftermath of the 1999 crisis, include ash-hazard zone maps, designated evacuation routes, and public alert protocols. Scientists estimate that the current repose period is well within the range of historical inter-eruption intervals and that future eruptions — potentially including VEI 3–4 dome-collapse events similar to 1660 or 1999 — are considered a matter of when, not if."

    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "Guagua Pichincha's hazard profile is dominated by its proximity to Quito. The active crater lies approximately 10 km west of the city's outermost suburbs, and the capital's 2.8 million residents are directly exposed to ashfall from any significant eruption. Hazard modeling based on the 1660 and 930 CE eruptions indicates that a VEI 4 event could deposit 5–30 cm of ash on Quito — enough to collapse weak roofs, disrupt water supplies, ground all aviation, cause respiratory health emergencies, and paralyze transportation networks. Ashfall would also severely impact agriculture in the Inter-Andean Valley.\n\nPyroclastic flows represent the most lethal hazard but are primarily directed westward through the amphitheater, away from Quito, meaning the city is partially shielded by the Rucu Pichincha ridge. However, pyroclastic surges — dilute, turbulent clouds of hot gas and fine particles that can override topographic barriers — could potentially reach western Quito neighborhoods under worst-case scenarios. Lahars (volcanic mudflows) generated by the remobilization of ash deposits during heavy rainfall are another significant hazard, potentially affecting river valleys draining both east toward Quito and west toward the coastal lowlands.\n\nCompared to other volcanoes threatening major cities — such as <a href=\"/volcano/vesuvius\">Vesuvius</a> (Naples, 3 million), <a href=\"/volcano/popocatepetl\">Popocatépetl</a> (Mexico City, 21 million at distance), or <a href=\"/volcano/rainier\">Rainier</a> (Tacoma/Seattle, lahar risk) — Guagua Pichincha's combination of frequent eruptions, close proximity, and a large exposed population places it among the most dangerous volcano-city pairings in the world."

    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "The Pichincha massif dominates the western skyline of Quito, with Guagua Pichincha's summit reaching 4,784 m (15,696 ft) and the adjacent Rucu Pichincha standing at 4,698 m (15,413 ft). The two peaks are connected by a broad saddle, and together they form an elongated north-south massif approximately 15 km long. The defining feature of Guagua Pichincha is the massive, 6-km-wide horseshoe-shaped amphitheater on its western flank, created by a late Pleistocene sector collapse approximately 50,000 years ago. This amphitheater opens westward toward the Pacific lowlands and contains the active crater, current lava dome, and fumarolic fields.\n\nThe volcano's eastern slopes — those facing Quito — are relatively gentle and heavily vegetated with Andean cloud forest and páramo grassland at higher elevations. The western slopes are steeper and more rugged, carved by deep valleys that channel pyroclastic flows and lahars during eruptions. The summit zone above approximately 4,200 m is dominated by barren volcanic rock, fumarole fields, and occasional frost. The TelefériQo cable car, one of Quito's major tourist attractions, ascends the eastern flank of the Pichincha massif to the Cruz Loma ridge at approximately 4,050 m, offering views of both Quito and — on clear days — the active crater area."

    "climate_and_global_impact": {
      "content": "Guagua Pichincha's eruptions have not produced measurable global climate impacts in recorded history. Even the large 1660 eruption, while devastating locally, did not inject sufficient aerosol into the stratosphere to cause detectable hemispheric cooling — its effects were regional rather than global. The ~930 CE VEI 5 eruption may have contributed to minor stratospheric sulfate loading, but this has not been conclusively identified in ice-core records, possibly due to the volcano's equatorial location (where stratospheric injection must be especially vigorous to achieve global distribution).\n\nHowever, Guagua Pichincha sits within one of the most volcanically dense regions on Earth. <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-ecuador\">Ecuador</a> contains over 30 Holocene volcanoes, and major eruptions from nearby peaks such as <a href=\"/volcano/cotopaxi\">Cotopaxi</a> and Tungurahua have had regionally significant atmospheric effects. The clustering of high-altitude volcanic centers along the Northern Andes means that simultaneous or sequential eruptions from multiple volcanoes could produce cumulative climate forcing — a scenario that volcanologists consider low-probability but high-consequence."

    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "Pichincha holds deep cultural and historical significance for Ecuador. The name 'Guagua' means 'baby' or 'child' in Quechua, distinguishing the younger, active western peak from 'Rucu' (old) Pichincha. The volcano features on Quito's coat of arms and is inseparable from the city's identity — Quito has been shaped, both literally and figuratively, by its relationship with the volcano over nearly five centuries of colonial and republican history.\n\nThe Battle of Pichincha on May 24, 1822, fought on the slopes of Rucu Pichincha, secured Ecuador's independence from Spain and remains one of the most important events in the nation's history. The date is a national holiday (Batalla de Pichincha Day), and the battle site on the volcano's flanks is a national monument. The volcano's eruptions have also permeated colonial literature and religious practice: the 1660 eruption generated extensive written accounts by Spanish chroniclers and prompted widespread religious processions, the memory of which persists in local cultural tradition.\n\nIn modern times, the Pichincha massif is central to Quito's outdoor recreation culture. The TelefériQo cable car, hiking trails, and mountain biking routes attract hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. Quito's designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (1978, the first cultural site so designated) is tied in part to its dramatic volcanic setting."

    "visiting_and_tourism": {
      "content": "The Pichincha massif is Quito's most prominent natural attraction. The TelefériQo cable car ascends from the Quito valley floor to the Cruz Loma ridge at approximately 4,050 m (13,287 ft) in about 15 minutes, offering spectacular views of the city and surrounding volcanoes including <a href=\"/volcano/cotopaxi\">Cotopaxi</a>, Cayambe, and Antisana. From the upper station, hikers can continue on a well-marked trail to the summit of Rucu Pichincha (4,698 m), a moderately challenging trek of approximately 3–4 hours round trip.\n\nReaching the active crater of Guagua Pichincha is a more demanding undertaking, typically requiring a full-day trek or a 4WD approach from the village of Lloa on the southern flank. The crater area is not a developed tourist site and access may be restricted during periods of elevated volcanic activity. The most accessible viewpoints for seeing the amphitheater and lava dome area are from the Rucu Pichincha summit trail.\n\nVisitors should be aware of the altitude — acclimatization is important, as even the TelefériQo upper station sits above 4,000 m. Weather changes rapidly, and afternoon cloud cover is common. The combination of high altitude, volcanic terrain, and potential for sudden weather changes means that proper equipment (warm layers, rain gear, sun protection) is essential for any hike beyond the cable car station."

    "nearby_volcanoes": {
      "content": "Guagua Pichincha is one of dozens of Holocene volcanoes in <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-ecuador\">Ecuador</a>, which has one of the highest concentrations of active volcanoes per unit area in the world. The most famous nearby volcano is <a href=\"/volcano/cotopaxi\">Cotopaxi</a>, located approximately 60 km to the southeast — one of the world's highest active stratovolcanoes at 5,897 m and the most iconic peak in the Ecuadorian Andes. Tungurahua (5,023 m), which erupted persistently from 1999 to 2016, lies approximately 130 km to the south and was erupting simultaneously with Guagua Pichincha during the 1999 crisis.\n\nOther notable volcanoes in the region include Cayambe (5,790 m), the highest point on the equator; Antisana (5,753 m); Reventador, one of Ecuador's most active volcanoes; and Chimborazo (6,263 m), the highest peak in Ecuador and the point on Earth's surface farthest from the planet's center. The entire chain is part of the Northern Volcanic Zone of the Andes, driven by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate."

    "etymology": {
      "content": "The name 'Guagua Pichincha' combines two Quechua words: 'guagua' (also spelled 'wawa'), meaning 'baby' or 'child,' and 'Pichincha,' whose etymology is debated. The most common interpretation derives 'Pichincha' from the Quechua 'pichiy' (to boil or bubble) and 'ncha' (a locative suffix), roughly translating to 'the place that boils' — a reference to the volcano's fumarolic and eruptive activity. An alternative theory suggests it derives from 'pichin' (small) combined with 'cha' (water), meaning 'little water.' The designation 'guagua' distinguishes the younger, active western peak from 'Rucu' (old) Pichincha, the dormant eastern summit."

    "Guagua Pichincha's active crater lies just 10 km from the western suburbs of Quito, making it one of the closest active volcanic vents to a national capital anywhere in the world.",
    "The name 'Guagua' means 'baby' or 'child' in Quechua, distinguishing the younger active western peak from 'Rucu' (old) Pichincha to the east.",
    "The 1660 eruption deposited up to 30 cm (12 inches) of ash on colonial Quito — turning day into night — and ash reportedly fell over a 1,000-km radius.",
    "A massive sector collapse approximately 50,000 years ago destroyed the volcano's western flank, creating a 6-km-wide horseshoe-shaped amphitheater that channels pyroclastic flows away from Quito.",
    "During the 1999 eruption crisis, Quito's international airport was closed multiple times due to ashfall, causing millions of dollars in economic losses.",
    "Guagua Pichincha was erupting simultaneously with Tungurahua volcano in 1999, creating a dual volcanic crisis unprecedented in Ecuador's modern history.",
    "The Battle of Pichincha (May 24, 1822), fought on the slopes of the volcano, secured Ecuador's independence from Spain and is commemorated as a national holiday.",
    "Ecuador's capital Quito was the first city designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site (1978), and its dramatic volcanic setting is part of its heritage value.",
    "The TelefériQo cable car ascending Pichincha's eastern flank is one of the highest aerial lifts in the world, reaching approximately 4,050 m (13,287 ft).",
    "Guagua Pichincha has erupted 44 times in approximately 9,000 years, but activity is highly clustered — 11 eruptions occurred in the 16th century alone.",
    "The volcano's andesitic lava dome grows incrementally between eruptions, building pressure until explosive failure occurs — a cycle that has repeated throughout the Holocene.",
    "Quito sits at approximately 2,850 m (9,350 ft) elevation, meaning ash from eruptions only needs to travel horizontally, not rise above the city — it falls from roughly the same altitude."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Guagua Pichincha active?",
      "answer": "Yes, Guagua Pichincha is classified as an active stratovolcano. It last erupted in 2002, and its most significant recent eruption occurred in 1999–2001, when explosions deposited ash on Quito and forced partial evacuations of the capital. The volcano has produced 44 recorded eruptions over approximately 9,000 years. It is continuously monitored by Ecuador's Instituto Geofísico (IG-EPN), which operates seismometers, gas sensors, GPS stations, and webcams around the volcano. Fumarolic activity within the crater continues, and scientists consider future eruptions not just possible but probable, given the volcano's historical eruption frequency."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did Guagua Pichincha last erupt?",
      "answer": "Guagua Pichincha's last confirmed eruption occurred in 2002, consisting of minor explosive activity rated VEI 1. The most significant recent eruption was the 1998–2001 crisis, which peaked on October 5, 1999, when a powerful Vulcanian explosion sent an ash column 15–20 km into the atmosphere and deposited several millimeters of ash across Quito. Multiple additional explosions occurred through late 1999 and into 2001, accompanied by lava dome growth within the western crater. Uncertain eruptions were reported as recently as 2009."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could Guagua Pichincha erupt again?",
      "answer": "Yes, future eruptions of Guagua Pichincha are considered highly likely by volcanologists. The volcano has averaged roughly one eruption every 200 years at VEI 3 or above over its historical record, and the current repose period since 2002 is well within the range of normal inter-eruption intervals. A lava dome emplaced during the 1999–2001 eruption remains in the crater and could serve as the focus of renewed activity. The IG-EPN monitoring network is designed to detect precursory signals — increasing seismicity, ground deformation, gas emissions — weeks to months before a major eruption, providing time for emergency response in Quito."
    },
    {
      "question": "How close is Guagua Pichincha to Quito?",
      "answer": "The active crater of Guagua Pichincha lies approximately 10 km (6.2 mi) west of Quito's nearest suburbs and roughly 15 km from the city center. The ridgeline of Rucu Pichincha, the older eastern peak of the massif, rises directly above the western edge of the city. This makes the Quito–Pichincha pairing one of the closest major city–active volcano relationships in the world, comparable to Naples and Vesuvius (9 km) or Kagoshima and Sakurajima (8 km). The Pichincha massif is visible from virtually every neighborhood in Quito."
    },
    {
      "question": "What would happen if Guagua Pichincha had a major eruption today?",
      "answer": "A VEI 4 eruption similar to 1660 would deposit 5–30 cm of ash on Quito, collapsing weak roofs, contaminating water supplies, grounding all aviation at Mariscal Sucre International Airport, causing severe respiratory health impacts, and paralyzing transportation. Pyroclastic flows would primarily travel westward through the amphitheater, away from the city, but dilute pyroclastic surges could potentially reach western neighborhoods. Lahars could affect river valleys draining toward the city. Economic losses would be measured in billions of dollars. Ecuador's emergency plans call for partial evacuation of western Quito neighborhoods and distribution of ash-protection equipment. The IG-EPN monitoring network is designed to provide days to weeks of warning before such an event."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall is Guagua Pichincha?",
      "answer": "Guagua Pichincha's summit stands at 4,784 m (15,696 ft) above sea level, making it one of the higher active volcanoes in the Northern Andes. The adjacent Rucu Pichincha reaches 4,698 m (15,413 ft). For context, Quito itself sits at approximately 2,850 m (9,350 ft), so the volcano rises roughly 1,934 m above the city. The Pichincha massif is dwarfed by Ecuador's highest volcanoes — Chimborazo at 6,263 m and Cotopaxi at 5,897 m — but its immediate proximity to the capital gives it outsize significance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of volcano is Guagua Pichincha?",
      "answer": "Guagua Pichincha is a stratovolcano (also called a composite volcano), built from alternating layers of lava flows, pyroclastic deposits, and volcanic ash. Its dominant eruption style involves the growth of andesitic lava domes within the summit crater, which periodically collapse or explode, generating pyroclastic flows and ash columns. A defining structural feature is the 6-km-wide horseshoe-shaped amphitheater on the western flank, created by a massive sector collapse approximately 50,000 years ago. This amphitheater channels pyroclastic flows westward and partially shields Quito from the most destructive volcanic hazards."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you hike Guagua Pichincha?",
      "answer": "Hiking on the Pichincha massif is popular, though reaching the active Guagua Pichincha crater is a serious undertaking. Most visitors take the TelefériQo cable car to the Cruz Loma ridge at ~4,050 m and hike to the summit of Rucu Pichincha (4,698 m), a moderately challenging 3–4 hour round trip. Reaching Guagua Pichincha's crater typically requires a full-day trek or a 4WD approach from the village of Lloa. Access to the crater area may be restricted during periods of elevated volcanic activity. Altitude acclimatization is essential, as the entire hike takes place above 4,000 m. Weather changes rapidly, and warm, waterproof layers are mandatory."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between Guagua Pichincha and Rucu Pichincha?",
      "answer": "Guagua and Rucu Pichincha are two distinct peaks forming a single volcanic massif. Rucu Pichincha (4,698 m) is the older, eastern peak — a deeply eroded Pleistocene stratovolcano considered extinct, with no eruptions in the Holocene. Guagua Pichincha (4,784 m) is the younger, western peak and the source of all historical volcanic activity. The name distinction reflects this relationship: 'Rucu' means 'old' and 'Guagua' means 'baby/child' in Quechua. Most Quito residents see primarily Rucu Pichincha from the city, while Guagua Pichincha's active crater is hidden behind the ridgeline on the volcano's western side."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Guagua Pichincha dangerous?",
      "answer": "Guagua Pichincha is dangerous primarily because of its extreme proximity to Quito, a city of 2.8 million people located just 10–15 km east of the active crater. The volcano's andesitic eruption style produces explosive dome-collapse events that generate pyroclastic flows and thick ashfall — hazards that can paralyze a modern city. The 1660 eruption deposited 30 cm of ash on colonial Quito, and the 1999 eruption shut down the international airport and prompted emergency evacuations. A VEI 5 eruption similar to the ~930 CE event would be catastrophic for the capital. The volcanic record shows 44 eruptions in 9,000 years, indicating that significant eruptions recur on timescales of centuries — well within planning horizons."
