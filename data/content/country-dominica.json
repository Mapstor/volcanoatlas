    "overview": {
      "content": "Dominica has 5 Holocene volcanoes packed onto a mountainous Caribbean island measuring just 750 km², giving it the highest density of potentially active volcanic centres of any island in the Lesser Antilles. Known as the \"Nature Isle of the Caribbean,\" Dominica is, in geological terms, essentially a volcanic edifice rising from the sea floor — the entire island is built from the overlapping products of these five volcanic systems. The volcanoes form a north-south chain running the length of the island: Morne aux Diables at the northern tip, [[volcano:diablotins-morne|Morne Diablotins]] (the island's highest peak at 1,430 m / 4,692 ft) in the north-centre, the [[volcano:trois-pitons-morne|Morne Trois Pitons]]/Micotrin complex and [[volcano:watt-morne|Morne Watt]] in the centre, and [[volcano:plat-pays-morne|Morne Plat Pays]] at the southern tip. Unlike the better-known volcanic islands of the Lesser Antilles such as Montserrat or Martinique, Dominica has not experienced a major magmatic eruption in historical times. However, the island's vigorous hydrothermal systems — including the world-famous Boiling Lake, the Valley of Desolation, and numerous hot springs — demonstrate that magma remains close to the surface. The most recent eruptions were phreatic (steam-driven) events at the Valley of Desolation in 1880 and 1997, associated with the Morne Watt volcanic complex. Dominica's volcanic hazards are monitored by the [[ext:https://uwiseismic.com/|University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre]] (UWI-SRC)."

    "why_dominica_has_volcanoes": {
      "content": "Dominica owes its existence to the subduction of the Atlantic oceanic lithosphere beneath the Caribbean Plate along the Lesser Antilles subduction zone. The Atlantic Plate descends westward at a rate of approximately 18–20 mm per year, and as it reaches depths of 100–150 km, water released from the subducting slab triggers partial melting of the overlying mantle wedge. The resulting magma — predominantly andesitic in composition — rises through the thin oceanic crust (less than 15 km thick) to build the volcanic arc. The Lesser Antilles Arc extends roughly 850 km from Grenada in the south to Saba in the north, with Dominica located near the centre of the arc's most active segment. The island sits on the inner arc, which contains the younger, currently active volcanic centres, as opposed to the older, extinct outer arc islands such as Antigua and Barbuda. Dominica's unusually high volcanic density is partly explained by its position at a segment of the arc where the subducting slab geometry allows particularly vigorous magma generation. The thin oceanic crust beneath the island allows relatively rapid ascent of magma, and the andesitic-to-dacitic compositions produce the lava domes and explosive eruptions characteristic of the island's volcanic history. This tectonic setting is fundamentally similar to that of neighbouring [[country:france|Martinique]] (home to the infamous [[volcano:pelee|Mont Pelée]]) and nearby [[special:ring-of-fire|Ring of Fire]] subduction zones."

      "content": "**Morne Diablotins** — The tallest peak in Dominica at 1,430 m (4,692 ft), [[volcano:diablotins-morne|Morne Diablotins]] dominates the northern half of the island. This large stratovolcano features a complex of at least five coalescing lava domes at its broad summit. The Grand Savanne Ignimbrite — pyroclastic flow deposits emplaced 22,000–40,000 years ago — extends in five radial lobes around the volcano, reaching the coast. Relatively unweathered block-and-ash flow aprons on the northwest flank suggest pre-Columbian activity. Though no confirmed historical eruptions are known, hot springs and submarine hydrothermal vents near Glanvillia on the northwest coast indicate an active magmatic system. Severe earthquake swarms in 1841 and 1893 may have originated from Morne Diablotins.\n\n**Morne Trois Pitons / Micotrin** — The [[volcano:trois-pitons-morne|Morne Trois Pitons]] complex, at 1,387 m (4,551 ft), is the centrepiece of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Morne Trois Pitons National Park, established in 1997. Two large lava dome complexes — Morne Trois Pitons and Micotrin (Morne Macaque) — sit within a large semicircular depression on the western coast of central Dominica. This area was the source of the voluminous Roseau Tuff, a thick sequence of pyroclastic flows erupted between approximately 40,000 and 25,000 years ago. The most recent dated eruption occurred around 920 CE from the Micotrin dome.\n\n**Morne Watt** — [[volcano:watt-morne|Morne Watt]] (1,224 m / 4,016 ft) is the only volcano in Dominica with confirmed historical eruptions. Located southeast of the Trois Pitons complex, Morne Watt's flanks host the island's two most famous volcanic features: the Valley of Desolation and the Boiling Lake. The Valley of Desolation is a dramatic hydrothermal area with boiling mud pools, fumaroles, and sulphur-encrusted vents. The Boiling Lake — the second-largest thermally active lake in the world at approximately 60 m across — fills a flooded fumarole and maintains temperatures near 90°C. A moderately large phreatic explosion in January 1880 deposited ash over a 4-km-wide sector at the coast, 10 km from the vent. A smaller phreatic event in July 1997 confined ashfall to the Valley of Desolation area.\n\n**Morne Plat Pays** — The [[volcano:plat-pays-morne|Morne Plat Pays]] volcanic complex (940 m / 3,084 ft) occupies the southern tip of Dominica. An arcuate caldera formed approximately 39,000 years ago through a major explosive eruption and flank collapse, open to Soufrière Bay on the west. At least a dozen post-caldera lava domes were emplaced within and outside this depression, including a submarine dome south of Scotts Head. The most recent dated eruption was from the Morne Patates lava dome around 1270 CE. Extensive fumarolic activity continues, and at least ten earthquake swarms have occurred since 1765.\n\n**Morne aux Diables** — The northernmost volcanic centre, [[volcano:diables-morne-aux|Morne aux Diables]] (Devils Peak, 861 m / 2,825 ft), forms the northern tip of Dominica. The lava dome complex includes seven andesitic domes, nested craters, and a cold soufrière with bubbling springs. No confirmed eruptions are recorded, but the youngest domes may be late Pleistocene to Holocene in age. Shallow volcano-tectonic seismicity was detected in 2009–2010."
    },

    "eruption_history": {
      "content": "Dominica's confirmed eruption record spans approximately 6,700 years, with 11 events across four of its five volcanic centres. The record is modest in number but reveals a pattern of both explosive pyroclastic-flow-producing eruptions and quieter lava dome emplacement. The oldest recorded Holocene eruption was at Morne Plat Pays around 4740 BCE. Morne Watt has the longest individual eruption record, with five events dating from approximately 1800 BCE to the most recent phreatic eruption in July 1997. The Trois Pitons/Micotrin complex produced pyroclastic flows around 790 and 920 CE, while Morne Plat Pays last erupted around 1270 CE from the Morne Patates dome. The two historical eruptions — both from the Valley of Desolation thermal area on Morne Watt's flanks — were phreatic (steam-driven) rather than magmatic, meaning no fresh magma reached the surface. The 1880 event was significantly larger, depositing ash over a 4-km sector reaching the coast, while the 1997 event was smaller and more localised. Notably, the Roseau Tuff eruptions of 40,000–25,000 years ago were among the most voluminous pyroclastic events in the Lesser Antilles, demonstrating that Dominica's volcanoes are capable of very large explosive eruptions despite the relatively quiet Holocene record."

    "volcanic_hazards": {
      "content": "Dominica's volcanic hazards are amplified by the island's small size (750 km²), mountainous terrain, limited road network, and the presence of approximately 72,000 people concentrated in coastal settlements. A significant eruption from any of the five volcanic centres could affect the entire island. The primary hazards include pyroclastic flows, tephra fall, lahars (volcanic mudflows channelled down steep valleys), volcanic gases, and lateral blasts. Pyroclastic flows are the most lethal threat — the 1902 eruption of Mont Pelée on neighbouring Martinique killed 29,000 people in minutes, and Dominica's volcanoes share the same explosive potential. The dense tropical vegetation covering Dominica's volcanic slopes could generate devastating lahars when mixed with pyroclastic debris and heavy tropical rainfall. The Valley of Desolation's ongoing hydrothermal activity means phreatic eruptions could occur with minimal warning, potentially endangering the thousands of hikers who visit the Boiling Lake trail annually. Dominica's volcanic monitoring is coordinated by the UWI Seismic Research Centre, which operates a network of seismic stations across the island."

    "volcanic_zones_map": {
      "content": "Dominica's five Holocene volcanoes are arranged in a roughly linear north-south chain spanning the full 47-km length of the island, paralleling the subduction zone to the east. From north to south: Morne aux Diables (15.61°N) at the northern tip, Morne Diablotins (15.50°N) in the northern interior, the Morne Trois Pitons/Micotrin complex (15.37°N) and Morne Watt (15.31°N) in the central-southern interior, and Morne Plat Pays (15.26°N) at the southern tip. The central pair — Morne Watt and Morne Trois Pitons — are separated by only 7 km and share overlapping volcanic features."
    },

    "impact_on_culture_and_economy": {
      "content": "Dominica's volcanic heritage is central to its identity and economy. The island markets itself as the Nature Isle of the Caribbean, and its volcanic landscapes — hot springs, the Boiling Lake, sulphur-scented valleys, and cloud-forest-draped peaks — are its primary tourism draw. The Morne Trois Pitons National Park was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, recognising its volcanic scenery and biodiversity. The Boiling Lake trail is the island's most popular hike. Volcanic geothermal energy is an increasingly important resource: the Wotten Waven geothermal field provides approximately 30% of Dominica's electricity, with plans for expansion toward 100% renewable energy. The fertile volcanic soils support agriculture — particularly bananas, citrus, and root crops. The indigenous Kalinago people incorporated the volcanic hot springs into their cultural practices long before European contact."

    "visiting_volcanoes": {
      "content": "Dominica offers some of the Caribbean's most dramatic volcanic experiences, largely within the UNESCO-listed Morne Trois Pitons National Park. The Boiling Lake trail is the signature hike — a challenging 13 km (8 miles) round trip from the village of Laudat, crossing the Valley of Desolation with its steaming fumaroles, bubbling mud pools, and multi-coloured mineral deposits before reaching the lake itself. A licensed guide is required. The Titou Gorge, near the trailhead, offers a volcanic hot spring swimming experience in a narrow canyon. Wotten Waven has several commercial hot spring pools heated by volcanic activity. Sulphur Springs near Soufrière provides accessible volcanic viewing. Morne Diablotins can be climbed via a trail from Syndicate, passing through the Sisserou Parrot habitat. The Scotts Head/Soufrière area at the southern tip offers excellent diving over volcanic underwater features. The best time to visit is during the dry season (February–June)."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How many volcanoes are in Dominica?",
      "answer": "Dominica has 5 Holocene volcanoes recognised by the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program: Morne aux Diables, Morne Diablotins, Morne Trois Pitons, Morne Watt, and Morne Plat Pays. These five centres span the full length of the island from north to south. Dominica is sometimes called the most volcanic island in the Lesser Antilles because of this high concentration of active centres on such a small landmass. The entire island is essentially constructed from the overlapping products of these volcanic systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dominica volcanic?",
      "answer": "Yes, Dominica is entirely volcanic in origin. The island is built from the accumulated lava flows, pyroclastic deposits, and lava domes produced by its five Holocene volcanic centres over hundreds of thousands of years. Volcanic activity continues today in the form of hot springs, fumaroles, the famous Boiling Lake, and the Valley of Desolation hydrothermal area. The most recent eruption was a phreatic event at the Valley of Desolation in July 1997. Dominica sits on the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc, created by the subduction of the Atlantic Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Boiling Lake in Dominica?",
      "answer": "The Boiling Lake is a thermally active lake located on the eastern flank of Morne Watt volcano in the Morne Trois Pitons National Park. It is the second-largest hot lake in the world (after Frying Pan Lake in New Zealand), measuring approximately 60 m across. The lake fills a flooded fumarole — a volcanic vent — and is heated by magmatic gases rising from depth. Water temperatures reach approximately 90°C at the edges, with the centre often obscured by steam. The lake's water level and temperature have fluctuated dramatically over the decades, occasionally draining partially during episodes of increased volcanic activity."
    },
    {
      "question": "When was the last volcanic eruption in Dominica?",
      "answer": "The most recent volcanic eruption in Dominica occurred on July 15, 1997, when a small phreatic (steam-driven) explosion took place at the Valley of Desolation, a hydrothermal area on the flank of Morne Watt volcano. Ashfall was confined to the immediate area. Before that, a larger phreatic eruption occurred at the same location in January 1880, depositing ash over a 4-km-wide sector reaching the coast. Neither event involved fresh magma reaching the surface — both were powered by superheated groundwater flashing to steam. Dominica has not experienced a magmatic eruption in the modern historical record."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could a volcano erupt in Dominica?",
      "answer": "Yes, future volcanic eruptions in Dominica are considered certain over geological timescales, and possible within human lifetimes. All five of the island's volcanic centres retain active hydrothermal systems, indicating magma at shallow depth. The geological record shows that Dominica's volcanoes have produced large explosive eruptions, including the voluminous Roseau Tuff pyroclastic flows 25,000–40,000 years ago. The University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre monitors the island with a network of seismic stations and maintains a volcanic alert level system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dominica safe to visit despite its volcanoes?",
      "answer": "Yes, Dominica is generally safe to visit. The island's volcanoes are currently at green (normal) alert level, and the volcanic hazards are well-monitored by the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre. The most visited volcanic features — the Boiling Lake, Valley of Desolation, and Sulphur Springs — are accessible with licensed guides and have established safety protocols. Visitors should stay on marked trails, not approach boiling features too closely, and heed any advisories. The volcanic landscape is the island's primary attraction, and thousands of visitors enjoy these sites safely each year."
