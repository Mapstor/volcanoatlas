      "content": "Izalco is a young, steep-sided <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> in western <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-el-salvador\">El Salvador</a>, standing 1,950 m (6,398 ft) above sea level and rising approximately 650 m above its base on the southern flank of the larger Santa Ana (Ilamatepec) volcano. It is one of the youngest volcanoes in the Western Hemisphere, having been born on February 23, 1770, when observers reported a new eruption emerging from the forested slopes of Santa Ana. Over the next 196 years, nearly continuous Strombolian eruptions built a symmetrical cone of basaltic andesite tephra and lava flows that earned Izalco the nickname 'El Faro del Pacifico' (the Lighthouse of the Pacific), as its nighttime glow was reportedly visible to ships navigating the Pacific coast of Central America. This remarkable chapter of persistent activity ended in 1966, and Izalco has been dormant for almost six decades. The volcano sits along the Central American Volcanic Arc, where the Cocos Plate subducts beneath the Caribbean Plate, and is part of the Salvadoran volcanic chain that includes Santa Ana, San Salvador, and San Miguel. Despite its current quiescence, Izalco remains one of El Salvador's most iconic natural landmarks, and its dark, nearly barren cone rising beside the older, green-clad Santa Ana creates one of Central America's most visually striking volcanic landscapes."
    },
    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Izalco is a product of the Central American Volcanic Arc, generated by the subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate at the Middle America Trench, located approximately 150 km to the southwest. The subducting slab reaches depths of roughly 100-150 km beneath western El Salvador, driving dehydration reactions that trigger partial melting of the mantle wedge and producing andesitic to basaltic andesitic magma.\n\nWhat makes Izalco volcanologically remarkable is its age: the entire 650-m-high edifice was constructed from scratch in less than 200 years. The volcano began growing in 1770 as a fissure eruption on the southern flank of Santa Ana volcano, likely exploiting a pre-existing zone of structural weakness. Despite growing on Santa Ana's slopes, Izalco's lavas are geochemically distinct from those of its parent volcano and from Santa Ana's fissure-controlled flank vents, suggesting an independent magma source. The rapid edifice construction rate — averaging over 3 m of height gain per year during the most active periods — is exceptional among subduction-zone volcanoes and compares favorably with Mexico's Paricutin, which grew to approximately 424 m between 1943 and 1952. Izalco's rock composition is predominantly basaltic andesite (52-57% SiO2), producing eruptions intermediate between fluid effusions and explosive blasts."

    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "The Smithsonian GVP records 53 eruptions for Izalco between 1770 and 1966. This count represents the most extraordinary concentration of activity in the short life of any volcano in the Americas. For most of the period from 1770 to 1958, the intervals between eruptions were measured in months rather than years, with many eruptions separated by only brief pauses in essentially continuous activity. The vast majority were rated VEI 2 (Strombolian explosions with minor lava flows), with two episodes reaching VEI 3: the 1925-1927 eruption and the prolonged 1948-1957 eruption, the most energetic sustained activity in Izalco's history. Lava flows primarily erupted from flank vents, traveling as far as approximately 7 km south down the slopes. The cessation of activity after October 1966 was unexpected, and the reasons remain a subject of scientific discussion."

          "content": "The birth of Volcan de Izalco was observed on February 23, 1770, when a new vent opened on the forested southern flank of Santa Ana volcano. Eyewitness accounts describe fire and smoke emerging from the mountainside, followed by Strombolian explosions that began building a cone of tephra and scoria. This marked the beginning of one of the most sustained volcanic eruptions in recorded history. Within years, a recognizable cone had formed, and by the early 19th century, Izalco had grown into a prominent feature of the Salvadoran landscape. The eruption was rated VEI 2. The birth of Izalco in a populated, agriculturally active region generated both fear and fascination among local communities."

          "content": "The eruption that began in December 1925 and continued through 1927 was one of Izalco's most powerful episodes, rated VEI 3. Vigorous Strombolian and Vulcanian explosions sent eruption columns several kilometers high, and lava flows descended the cone's flanks. This period coincided with Izalco's reputation as one of the most reliably active volcanoes on Earth, drawing attention from early 20th-century volcanologists. The VEI 3 rating indicates eruption columns reaching 3-15 km altitude and the ejection of material volumes on the order of 10 million cubic meters."

          "content": "The longest single eruption episode at Izalco began on November 4, 1948, and continued for approximately nine years until 1957. The volcano erupted almost continuously, with Strombolian explosions visible from considerable distances and lava flows descending the southwest and northeast flanks. This eruption produced significant new tephra deposits and lava flows that extended the cone's footprint. Rated VEI 3, this was the volcano's sustained climax — the culmination of nearly two centuries of cone-building that would end less than a decade later. The prolonged nature of this eruption cemented Izalco's international fame as the Lighthouse of the Pacific."

          "content": "Izalco's last eruption occurred on October 28, 1966, from a vent on the south-southeast flank approximately 550 m below the summit. Rated VEI 0, it was a minor effusive event — a far cry from the spectacular Strombolian displays that had characterized the volcano for nearly two centuries. The eruption was brief and produced only a small lava flow. Remarkably, this unassuming event marked the end of Izalco's active period. The volcano has not erupted since, entering dormancy lasting nearly 60 years. Ironically, the Hotel de Montana Cerro Verde was constructed on the neighboring ridge in the early 1960s to give tourists a spectacular view of Izalco's eruptions — but the volcano fell silent before the hotel could capitalize on the spectacle."

    "current_status_and_monitoring": {
      "content": "Izalco has been dormant since its last eruption on October 28, 1966 — a repose period approaching six decades, the longest period of inactivity since the volcano's birth in 1770. No significant fumarolic activity, seismic swarms, or ground deformation have been reported at Izalco in recent years. The volcano is monitored by MARN (El Salvador's Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources), which operates a network of seismic stations across the Salvadoran volcanic arc.\n\nWhether Izalco's silence represents a temporary pause or the permanent end of its eruptive phase remains an open question. A 60-year pause is not unusual for a volcano with a 200-year history. Some researchers have suggested that the magma supply feeding Izalco may have been diverted or exhausted, while others argue that the conduit may simply be plugged. The neighboring Santa Ana volcano, from whose flank Izalco grew, experienced a phreatomagmatic eruption in 2005 (VEI 3), demonstrating that the broader volcanic system remains active."
    },
    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "If Izalco were to resume activity, the primary hazards would include Strombolian explosions producing ballistic projectiles and tephra fall, lava flows descending the steep flanks, and potentially more explosive Vulcanian eruptions if magma composition has evolved during dormancy. The city of Sonsonate (population ~70,000) lies approximately 10 km to the south, and numerous smaller communities exist on the volcano's lower slopes. Total population within 10 km is estimated at roughly 200,000.\n\nThe greater hazard in the region may come from Izalco's parent volcano, Santa Ana (Ilamatepec), which is larger, more explosive, and more recently active (VEI 3 in 2005). <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-el-salvador\">El Salvador</a> is one of the most volcanically exposed countries relative to its small size, with 16 Holocene volcanoes in just 21,000 km2, and volcanic risk management is a major component of national disaster preparedness."

    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "Izalco presents a nearly perfect conical profile when viewed from the south, with steep slopes of 30-35 degrees covered in dark basaltic andesite scoria and tephra that have resisted significant vegetation colonization despite nearly 60 years of dormancy. The summit is truncated by a crater approximately 250 m wide. The cone rises roughly 650 m above its base on the southern flank of Santa Ana, whose much larger edifice (2,381 m) provides a dramatic green backdrop. The adjacent Cerro Verde (2,030 m), an extinct volcanic peak now covered in cloud forest, completes a scenic trio of volcanoes. The Cerro Verde viewpoint offers one of Central America's most photographed volcanic vistas: the dark, barren cone of Izalco set against the lush forest of Cerro Verde and the massive bulk of Santa Ana. Lake Coatepeque, a scenic crater lake occupying a large caldera to the east, adds further volcanic context to the region."

    "climate_and_global_impact": {
      "content": "Izalco's eruptions, while persistent, were of modest magnitude (predominantly VEI 2 with occasional VEI 3 events) and did not produce significant climatic effects beyond the immediate region. By contrast, larger eruptions along the Central American Volcanic Arc — such as the VEI 6 eruption of Ilopango in El Salvador around 431 CE, which may have contributed to the global cooling event of 535-536 CE — have had demonstrable hemispheric impacts. Izalco's atmospheric contributions were limited to localized sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions."
    },
    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "Izalco holds a distinctive place in Salvadoran national identity. Its nickname, 'El Faro del Pacifico' (the Lighthouse of the Pacific), is one of the most evocative in volcanology, encapsulating the image of a perpetually burning beacon visible to Pacific seafarers. The name derived from sailors' accounts of seeing the volcano's nighttime glow from ships offshore, providing a reliable navigational landmark for vessels approaching Central America. The sudden cessation of eruptions in 1966 was noted with a mix of relief and cultural loss, as a defining feature of El Salvador's western landscape had gone dark. The coincidence of the Hotel de Montana Cerro Verde being built to view the eruptions just before they stopped has become a popular anecdote illustrating volcanic unpredictability. Today, Izalco features prominently in Salvadoran tourism marketing and educational materials, and its striking silhouette appears in regional artwork and photography."

    "visiting_and_tourism": {
      "content": "Izalco is a popular hiking destination within Cerro Verde National Park in western El Salvador. The standard route begins at the Cerro Verde visitor center and descends through cloud forest before crossing a saddle (the Paso del Leon) and ascending Izalco's barren scoria slopes to the summit crater. The round-trip hike takes approximately 4-6 hours and involves roughly 800 m of elevation gain from the saddle. The ascent is physically demanding due to the steep, loose scoria, but the summit rewards hikers with panoramic views encompassing Santa Ana volcano, Lake Coatepeque, the Pacific coast, and on clear days, volcanoes in Guatemala and Honduras. The summit crater is approximately 250 m wide and can be partially descended. Park entrance fees apply, and guided hikes are available. The best time to visit is during El Salvador's dry season (November-April). The nearby Santa Ana volcano crater (with its turquoise acid lake) and Cerro Verde's cloud forest trails offer complementary experiences."

Cerro Verde, an extinct stratovolcano, forms the third member of this volcanic group. To the east, Lake Coatepeque fills a large caldera formed by prehistoric eruptions. Further along the Salvadoran volcanic arc, San Salvador volcano overlooks the national capital, and San Miguel (Chaparrastique) in eastern El Salvador is one of the country's most active volcanoes, with a VEI 2 eruption in 2013. The Central American Volcanic Arc extends northwest into <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-guatemala\">Guatemala</a>, where <a href=\"/volcano/fuego\">Fuego</a> and Pacaya maintain frequent activity."

    "etymology": {
      "content": "The name 'Izalco' derives from the Nahuatl indigenous language. The Nahuatl word 'Itzalco' is thought to mean 'place of obsidian sand' or 'place where obsidian water flows,' referencing the dark volcanic material that characterizes the region. The town of Izalco, located on the volcano's southeastern slopes, predates the volcano's 1770 birth and gave its name to the erupting peak."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why is Izalco called the Lighthouse of the Pacific?",
      "answer": "Izalco earned the nickname 'El Faro del Pacifico' (the Lighthouse of the Pacific) because its nearly continuous Strombolian eruptions from 1770 to 1966 produced a persistent nighttime glow of incandescent lava fountains and red-hot tephra visible from the Pacific Ocean. Sailors navigating the coast of Central America reportedly used the volcano's glow as a navigational landmark, as it served as a reliable beacon for nearly two centuries. The name captured the popular imagination and remains Izalco's most famous association, even though the volcano has been dormant since 1966."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did Izalco last erupt?",
      "answer": "Izalco last erupted on October 28, 1966, from a vent on the south-southeast flank approximately 550 m below the summit. The eruption was a minor effusive event rated VEI 0, producing only a small lava flow. This unassuming eruption marked the end of nearly 200 years of near-continuous volcanic activity that had begun with the volcano's birth in 1770. As of 2026, Izalco has been dormant for almost 60 years, the longest period of inactivity in its entire existence. No significant signs of renewed unrest have been detected."
    },
    {
      "question": "How old is Izalco volcano?",
      "answer": "Izalco is one of the youngest volcanoes on Earth. It was born on February 23, 1770, when a new vent opened on the southern flank of Santa Ana volcano in western El Salvador. The entire 650-m-high edifice was built from scratch over the following 196 years through 53 documented eruptions. This makes Izalco only 256 years old as of 2026. For comparison, most stratovolcanoes are built over tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Izalco's rapid construction is comparable to Mexico's Paricutin, which grew approximately 424 m in nine years (1943-1952)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you hike Izalco volcano?",
      "answer": "Yes, Izalco is a popular hiking destination within Cerro Verde National Park in western El Salvador. The standard route begins at the Cerro Verde visitor center, descends through cloud forest, crosses the Paso del Leon saddle, and ascends Izalco's barren scoria slopes to the summit crater. The round trip takes approximately 4-6 hours with roughly 800 m of elevation gain from the saddle. The climb is physically demanding due to steep, loose volcanic scoria. The summit offers panoramic views of Santa Ana volcano, Lake Coatepeque, the Pacific coast, and neighboring countries. Park entrance fees apply and guided tours are available. The dry season (November-April) is the best time to visit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Izalco volcano extinct or dormant?",
      "answer": "Izalco is classified as dormant rather than extinct. Although the volcano has not erupted since October 28, 1966 — a repose period of almost 60 years — this is considered insufficient time to declare a 256-year-old volcano extinct. Volcanologists generally consider a volcano extinct only after it shows no signs of activity over a period much longer than its historical eruption intervals. Izalco's parent volcano, Santa Ana, erupted as recently as 2005, confirming that the broader magmatic system remains active. Whether Izalco will erupt again is unknown, but its classification remains dormant pending further evidence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall is Izalco?",
      "answer": "Izalco stands at 1,950 m (6,398 ft) above sea level. However, because it grew on the southern flank of Santa Ana volcano rather than from flat ground, the cone itself rises approximately 650 m above its base — representing the total material constructed since the volcano's birth in 1770. The 250-m-wide summit crater adds further elevation definition. For context, Izalco's parent volcano Santa Ana is significantly taller at 2,381 m (7,812 ft) and is the highest volcano in El Salvador."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of volcano is Izalco?",
      "answer": "Izalco is classified as a stratovolcano (composite volcano), built from alternating layers of lava flows and tephra (volcanic fragments) erupted during its nearly 200 years of activity. The dominant rock type is basaltic andesite, which produces eruptions intermediate between the fluid lava flows of basaltic volcanoes and the explosive blasts of more silica-rich stratovolcanoes. Izalco's eruption style was predominantly Strombolian — regular explosions hurling incandescent lava fragments into the air — interspersed with lava flows from flank vents. The resulting cone is notably steep (30-35 degrees) and symmetrical."

      "question": "Why did Izalco stop erupting?",
      "answer": "The exact reason Izalco stopped erupting in 1966 after nearly 200 years of activity is not definitively known. Several hypotheses have been proposed: the magma supply feeding Izalco may have been diverted to a different pathway, the conduit may have become plugged by solidified magma, or the magmatic pressure driving eruptions may have decreased. Some researchers have noted that the eruption of neighboring Santa Ana in 2005 suggests the regional magmatic system remains active, so Izalco's dormancy may be temporary. However, the possibility that Izalco's eruptive phase has permanently ended cannot be ruled out."
