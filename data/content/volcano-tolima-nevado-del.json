      "content": "Nevado del Tolima is an active, glacier-covered <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> rising to 5,215 m (17,110 ft) in the Central Cordillera of <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-colombia\">Colombia</a>, within Los Nevados National Natural Park. It stands approximately 30 km south of the more famous <a href=\"/volcano/ruiz-nevado-del\">Nevado del Ruiz</a>, whose catastrophic 1985 eruption killed over 23,000 people in the town of Armero — a disaster that underscores the lahar hazard posed by all glacier-capped Andean volcanoes, including Tolima. The steep-sided, conical edifice contrasts sharply with Ruiz's broad profile, and its summit glaciers, though rapidly diminishing due to climate change, remain a visually dramatic feature. Tolima's eruption history spans at least 10,000 years and includes a VEI 5 Plinian eruption approximately 3,600 years ago — evidence that the volcano is capable of catastrophic explosive events. The Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program records 12 eruptions, with the most recent being minor explosive activity in March 1943. The volcano is part of the Northern Andean Volcanic Arc, generated by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate, and sits within the <a href=\"/ring-of-fire\">Ring of Fire</a>. Ibague, the capital of Tolima Department with approximately 580,000 residents, lies roughly 30 km to the southeast."

    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Nevado del Tolima is an andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano whose younger cone was built during the past approximately 40,000 years, rising above and largely obscuring a 3-km-wide late-Pleistocene caldera. The volcano sits atop thick continental crust (> 25 km) within the Northern Andean Volcanic Arc, where the Nazca Plate subducts eastward beneath the South American Plate at approximately 5-6 cm per year. The summit region consists of a cluster of late-Pleistocene to Holocene lava domes associated with thick block-lava flows on the north and east flanks, surrounded by extensive pyroclastic-flow deposits. A funnel-shaped summit crater, 200-300 m deep, sits at the apex of the edifice. The volcano's magmatic compositions are predominantly andesitic to dacitic — silica-rich, viscous magmas that favor explosive eruption styles. Holocene activity has ranged from moderate explosive eruptions to full Plinian events, with lava dome growth producing block-and-ash flows that traveled primarily to the northeast and southeast. The geological record indicates at least one major Plinian eruption (~1990 BCE, VEI 5) and a significant VEI 4 event around 7800 BCE, demonstrating a long history of powerful explosive capability."

    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "The Smithsonian database records 12 eruptions at Nevado del Tolima spanning from approximately 7800 BCE to 1943 CE. The early Holocene record includes a VEI 4 eruption around 7800 BCE and several undated events through the middle Holocene. The most significant eruption was the VEI 5 Plinian event approximately 3,600 years ago (~1990 BCE), which deposited widespread pyroclastic flow and tephra fall deposits across the surrounding landscape. Subsequent eruptions at <a href=\"/volcanic-explosivity-index\">VEI</a> 3 occurred around 610 BCE, 200 BCE, and 260 CE. The historical record is limited to minor explosive activity in the 19th and 20th centuries: eruptions in November 1822, March 1825, and May 1826 (all VEI 2), followed by a final recorded VEI 2 event in March 1943. The relatively modest scale of recent eruptions should not obscure the volcano's demonstrated capacity for Plinian-scale events."

          "content": "Approximately 3,600 years ago, Nevado del Tolima produced a massive VEI 5 Plinian eruption — the largest event in its known geological record. This eruption generated a towering eruption column and deposited extensive pyroclastic flow and tephra fall deposits across the surrounding terrain. The scale of this event places it in the same category as the 79 AD eruption of <a href=\"/volcano/vesuvius\">Vesuvius</a> and the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The pyroclastic deposits from this eruption are a key stratigraphic marker in the geology of the Central Cordillera region. Such events would have generated massive lahars traveling down all major drainages, a particularly concerning scenario given that glaciers would have been significantly larger at that time than today."

The 1822 eruption in November was followed by activity on March 2, 1825, and again in May 1826. This clustering suggests a sustained period of magmatic unrest, possibly involving the intrusion and partial eruption of a new batch of magma."

Monitoring includes seismic networks, GPS deformation measurements, and periodic gas and thermal surveys. The volcano's glaciers — though diminishing rapidly due to climate change — remain a critical factor in hazard assessment, as any future eruption could trigger lahars by melting ice and snow. Colombia's experience with the 1985 Armero disaster at <a href=\"/volcano/ruiz-nevado-del\">Nevado del Ruiz</a>, just 30 km to the north, has made lahar monitoring and early warning systems a national priority for all glacier-capped Andean volcanoes."

Lahar modeling indicates that flows could travel down the Combeima, Toche, and Totare river valleys, potentially reaching populated areas including the outskirts of Ibague (population ~580,000) in worst-case scenarios. Pyroclastic flows from the VEI 5 eruption ~3,600 years ago traveled at least 10-15 km from the summit, and tephra fall from such an event would blanket agricultural land across a wide area."

The summit crater is funnel-shaped, 200-300 m deep, surrounded by the remnants of glaciers that once extended much farther down the flanks. The volcano lies within Los Nevados National Natural Park, a protected area encompassing the high-altitude paramo ecosystem — a unique tropical alpine grassland found only in the northern Andes."

      "content": "Nevado del Tolima holds deep significance in Colombian culture. The volcano lends its name to the Tolima Department and is featured on the department's coat of arms. For the indigenous peoples of the Central Cordillera, the snow-capped peaks have long held spiritual importance. In modern Colombia, the volcano is a coveted mountaineering objective and one of the most challenging summit climbs in Los Nevados National Natural Park. The surrounding paramo ecosystem is increasingly recognized for its ecological importance as a critical water source for the agricultural regions downstream. The volcano's proximity to Colombia's Coffee Axis (Eje Cafetero) — a UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Landscape — connects it to one of the country's most important economic and cultural traditions."

      "content": "Nevado del Tolima is one of Colombia's premier high-altitude trekking and mountaineering destinations. The standard approach begins from the town of Juntas or Ibague, ascending through cloud forest and paramo to high-altitude campsites. The summit climb typically takes 3-5 days round trip and involves glacier travel, requiring crampons, ice axes, and experience with high-altitude mountaineering. Los Nevados National Natural Park requires permits and entrance fees, and guided expeditions are strongly recommended. The trek passes through spectacular paramo landscapes with frailejones (the distinctive giant rosette plants unique to the northern Andes), hot springs, and views of the volcanic chain. The best climbing season is typically December-February and June-August."

      "question": "How tall is Nevado del Tolima?",
      "answer": "Nevado del Tolima stands at 5,215 m (17,110 ft) above sea level, making it one of Colombia's tallest volcanoes and one of the highest active volcanoes in the Northern Andean Volcanic Arc. It is slightly shorter than its neighbor Nevado del Ruiz (5,279 m) and Nevado del Huila (5,364 m, Colombia's tallest active volcano), but its steeper, more conical profile gives it a dramatic visual presence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could Nevado del Tolima erupt like Nevado del Ruiz?",
      "answer": "Nevado del Tolima shares the same fundamental hazard profile as Nevado del Ruiz, which killed over 23,000 people in the 1985 Armero disaster through lahar generation. Both volcanoes are glacier-capped stratovolcanoes in the same volcanic arc. Tolima's geological record includes a VEI 5 Plinian eruption — actually larger than any known eruption at Ruiz — and any future eruption could melt glacial ice to generate destructive lahars. While Tolima's glaciers are smaller due to climate change, the hazard remains significant."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you climb Nevado del Tolima?",
      "answer": "Yes, Nevado del Tolima is a popular mountaineering objective in Colombia. The standard route takes 3-5 days round trip, beginning from Juntas or Ibague, ascending through cloud forest and paramo to high-altitude camps. The summit requires glacier travel with crampons and ice axes. Los Nevados National Natural Park requires permits. Guided expeditions are strongly recommended. The best seasons are December-February and June-August."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Tolima's glaciers disappearing?",
      "answer": "Yes, Nevado del Tolima's glaciers are retreating rapidly due to climate change. Colombia's glacier-covered volcanoes have lost an estimated 90% of their ice since the Little Ice Age, and scientists project that Tolima's remaining glaciers could disappear entirely within decades. This has both ecological consequences — the paramo ecosystem depends on glacial meltwater — and paradoxically reduces the lahar hazard somewhat, as less ice is available to melt during an eruption. However, sufficient ice remains to generate dangerous lahars."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did Nevado del Tolima last erupt?",
      "answer": "Nevado del Tolima last erupted in March 1943, with a minor VEI 2 explosive event that produced ash emissions from the summit crater. Before that, three eruptions occurred in quick succession between 1822 and 1826. While the recent eruptions have been small, the geological record demonstrates that the volcano is capable of much larger events — including a VEI 5 Plinian eruption approximately 3,600 years ago."
