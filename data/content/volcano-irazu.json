      "content": "Irazú (Volcán Irazú) is a massive active <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> rising to 3,436 m (11,273 ft) in the Central Volcanic Range of <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-costa-rica\">Costa Rica</a>, making it the tallest volcano in the country. Located immediately east of the capital city of San José and the historic city of Cartago, Irazú is one of the most consequential volcanoes in Central America from a population-risk perspective: approximately 2 million people live within its broader hazard zone in the densely populated Central Valley.\n\nThe volcano covers an area of approximately 500 km² and is vegetated to within a few hundred meters of its broad, complex summit crater system. At least 10 satellite cones dot its southern flank. All known Holocene eruptions have been explosive — no lava effusion has been documented since the Cervantes lava flows from south-flank vents approximately 14,000 years ago. Irazú has 31 recorded eruptions since approximately 640 BCE, with the most devastating modern event being the 1963–1965 eruption that deposited thick ash on San José and triggered destructive lahars in the Reventazón river valley. The volcano is protected within Irazú Volcano National Park, established in 1955, and its summit crater — often containing a vivid green or turquoise lake — is one of Costa Rica's most visited natural attractions. Irazú sits within the <a href=\"/ring-of-fire\">Ring of Fire</a>, driven by the subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate."
    },
    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Irazú is a broad, shield-like stratovolcano whose massive edifice reflects a long constructional history. The summit area hosts a complex of craters, with the focus of eruptions migrating westward over time toward the current main crater, approximately 1,050 m in diameter and 300 m deep, which frequently contains a strikingly colored lake. Adjacent craters include the Diego de la Haya Crater, named after a colonial-era governor, and the Playa Hermosa crater.\n\nThe tectonic engine is the subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate along the Middle America Trench, approximately 170 km to the southwest. This drives the Central American Volcanic Arc, of which Irazú is a prominent member. The volcano's andesitic to basaltic-andesitic composition is typical of subduction-zone volcanism. All known Holocene eruptions have been explosive — the last lava effusion occurred approximately 14,000 years ago from south-flank vents producing the Cervantes lava flows. This exclusively explosive Holocene character suggests a shift toward more volatile-rich, explosive magma supply. At least 10 parasitic cones on the southern flank indicate the volcanic system extends well beyond the main summit complex."

    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "Irazú has 31 recorded eruptions dating back to approximately 640 BCE. The pre-colonial record from tephrochronology identifies VEI 3 eruptions around 640 BCE, 430 CE, 690 CE, 1110 CE, and 1560 CE. The first well-documented historical eruption occurred in 1723, witnessed by Spanish colonial governor Diego de la Haya Fernández. From the 18th century onward, Irazú erupted frequently: events in 1723–1724, 1726, 1775, multiple episodes between 1821 and 1847, and numerous eruptions from 1864 through 1940. The <a href=\"/volcanic-explosivity-index\">VEI</a> 3 eruption of 1963–1965 was the most significant modern event. A minor eruption in 1977 (VEI 1) and uncertain phreatic activity in 1994 round out the record. The average recurrence interval for eruptions has been approximately 15–20 years during the historical period."

          "content": "Irazú's most significant modern eruption began on March 13, 1963, and continued for approximately two years. Rated VEI 3, this sustained explosive eruption deposited heavy ashfall on San José, Cartago, and the entire Central Valley — Costa Rica's most densely populated region. The eruption's timing was dramatic: it began the same day that U.S. President John F. Kennedy arrived in San José for a state visit, with ash reportedly falling on the presidential motorcade.\n\nOver the following two years, continuous ash emissions blanketed agricultural land, clogged drainage systems, and contaminated water supplies. The most devastating secondary effect was a series of catastrophic lahars in the Reventazón river valley, triggered when heavy tropical rains mobilized thick ash deposits on the volcano's flanks. These mudflows destroyed bridges, buried homes, and killed approximately 20 people. Economic losses to agriculture and infrastructure were substantial. The eruption permanently changed Costa Rica's approach to volcanic hazard management and led to the establishment of stronger monitoring programs."

The volcano is jointly monitored by OVSICORI-UNA and the Red Sismológica Nacional (RSN). The monitoring network includes seismometers, GPS deformation stations, gas measurements, and regular crater lake chemistry surveys — changes in lake temperature, pH, or chemical composition serve as sensitive indicators of subsurface changes.

The primary hazards are ashfall, lahars, and pyroclastic surges. During the 1963–1965 eruption, ash accumulations of several centimeters disrupted life across the Central Valley, and lahars killed approximately 20 people and destroyed infrastructure. A future eruption of similar intensity would affect a much larger and more developed urban population. Steep flanks and multiple river drainages create natural lahar conduits, amplified by Costa Rica's heavy tropical rainfall."

Adjacent craters include the Diego de la Haya Crater and Playa Hermosa. The volcano is vegetated to within a few hundred meters of the summit, with cloud forest on middle flanks giving way to páramo-like scrubland at higher elevations. On clear days, both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea are visible from the summit."

The 1963–1965 eruption is seared into Costa Rican national memory, coinciding with President Kennedy's visit and causing years of agricultural disruption. The volcano is a symbol of both natural beauty and natural hazard for Costa Ricans. The famous crater lake has become an iconic Costa Rican image, featured in tourism marketing and cultural media. The surrounding dairy farming landscape on the upper flanks — producing some of the country's finest cheese — adds an agricultural dimension to the volcano's cultural footprint."

It has 31 recorded eruptions, with the last confirmed magmatic eruption in 1977 (VEI 1) and uncertain phreatic activity reported in 1994. The most significant modern eruption was the 1963–1965 VEI 3 event that caused widespread destruction across Costa Rica's Central Valley. The volcano is continuously monitored by OVSICORI-UNA and RSN, and scientists consider future eruptions possible. The current dormancy period of approximately 50 years is within the historical range of inter-eruption intervals."

    },
    {
      "question": "What happened during the 1963 Irazú eruption?",
      "answer": "The 1963–1965 eruption was Costa Rica's most destructive modern volcanic event. Beginning on March 13, 1963, the VEI 3 eruption produced continuous ash emissions over approximately two years, blanketing San José, Cartago, and the Central Valley. The eruption coincided with U.S. President Kennedy's state visit. The most devastating impacts were lahars (volcanic mudflows) in the Reventazón river valley triggered by heavy rains mobilizing ash deposits, which killed approximately 20 people and destroyed bridges and homes. Agricultural and economic losses were severe."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall is Irazú?",
      "answer": "Irazú rises to 3,436 m (11,273 ft) above sea level, making it the tallest volcano in Costa Rica. Its neighboring volcano Turrialba is slightly shorter at 3,340 m. For comparison, Costa Rica's highest point overall is Cerro Chirripó at 3,821 m, which is not volcanic. Irazú's broad massif covers approximately 500 km², and on clear days both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts are visible from the summit — a span of over 200 km."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Irazú's crater lake different colors?",
      "answer": "Irazú's main crater lake changes color due to variations in its chemical and mineral composition. The lake can appear vivid emerald green, turquoise blue, or rust-red at different times. These changes reflect fluctuations in dissolved minerals (particularly sulfur and iron compounds), pH levels, suspended sediment, and volcanic gas input from the underlying hydrothermal system. Scientists monitor the lake's chemistry as an indicator of volcanic unrest — significant color or temperature changes can signal increased magmatic activity at depth."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Irazú dangerous?",
      "answer": "Irazú poses one of the highest volcanic risks in Central America. Approximately 2 million people live in the San José–Cartago metropolitan corridor within its ashfall hazard zone. The 1963–1965 eruption demonstrated the volcano's capacity for sustained explosive eruptions that disrupt life across the densely populated Central Valley. Lahars are a particular concern due to steep flanks, multiple river drainages, and heavy tropical rainfall. A future eruption of similar or greater intensity would affect a much larger urban population than existed in 1963."
