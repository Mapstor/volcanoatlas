      "content": "Indonesia has 101 Holocene volcanoes — the third-highest national count after [[country:united-states|the United States]] (165) and [[country:japan|Japan]] (105) — yet it leads the world with 73 historically active volcanoes, more than any other country on Earth. Spread across an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands stretching 5,100 km (3,170 mi) from Sumatra to Papua, Indonesia's volcanoes are the product of one of the most complex subduction systems on the planet, where the Indo-Australian, Eurasian, Philippine Sea, and Pacific plates collide and interact. The result is a volcanic arc system responsible for approximately 1,472 recorded eruptions in the Smithsonian database — including two of the largest eruptions in human history: the VEI 7 eruptions of [[volcano:tambora|Tambora]] in 1815 and [[volcano:rinjani|Rinjani]] (Samalas) in 1257. Indonesia sits squarely on the [[special:ring-of-fire|Ring of Fire]] and accounts for roughly 15% of the world's Holocene volcanoes. On any given day, between five and fifteen Indonesian volcanoes may be in a state of elevated alert, making the country's Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM, known locally as PVMBG) one of the busiest volcano monitoring agencies in the world. With more than 275 million people — many living on the fertile flanks of active volcanoes — Indonesia faces a volcanic hazard equation unmatched anywhere else: the greatest number of historically active volcanoes, the densest population exposure, and a history punctuated by catastrophic events that have reshaped global climate and killed tens of thousands."

    "why_indonesia_has_volcanoes": {
      "content": "Indonesia's extraordinary volcanic density is a direct consequence of its position at the convergence of three major tectonic plates. Along the country's southern and western margin, the Indo-Australian Plate subducts northeastward beneath the Eurasian Plate at rates of 60–70 mm per year, generating the 3,000 km (1,864 mi) Sunda Volcanic Arc that stretches from northwestern Sumatra through Java, Bali, Lombok, and into Flores. This arc alone accounts for 71 of Indonesia's 101 Holocene volcanoes and includes some of the world's most active and dangerous peaks — [[volcano:merapi|Merapi]], [[volcano:semeru|Semeru]], [[volcano:kelud|Kelud]], and [[volcano:krakatau|Krakatau]]. The subducting oceanic lithosphere descends to depths of 100–200 km, where increasing pressure and temperature release water from minerals in the slab, lowering the melting point of the overlying mantle wedge and producing magma that rises to feed the arc's volcanoes. East of Java, the tectonic picture becomes dramatically more complex. In the Maluku (Molucca) Sea region, a rare double subduction zone exists where the Molucca Sea Plate subducts simultaneously beneath both the Eurasian Plate to the west and the Philippine Sea Plate to the east, producing the opposing Sangihe and Halmahera volcanic arcs. The Sangihe Arc (11 volcanoes including [[volcano:karangetang|Karangetang]] and [[volcano:awu|Awu]]) and the Halmahera Arc (13 volcanoes including [[volcano:dukono|Dukono]], [[volcano:ibu|Ibu]], and [[volcano:gamalama|Gamalama]]) face each other across a shrinking ocean basin. Further south, the Banda Arc curves through the islands of Teon, Nila, Serua, and Banda Api in one of the tightest subduction bends on Earth. Indonesia's volcanic rock types reflect these varied tectonic settings: the majority of Indonesian volcanoes produce calc-alkaline andesite and basalt typical of subduction zones, though some — particularly in the Sunda Strait region — produce more evolved and explosive magma compositions. This tectonic complexity makes Indonesia not merely a volcanic country but a natural laboratory for understanding [[special:types-of-volcanoes|subduction volcanism]] in all its forms."

    "major_volcanoes": {
      "content": "**Merapi** — Rising to 2,910 m (9,547 ft) in Central Java just 28 km (17 mi) north of the city of Yogyakarta, [[volcano:merapi|Mount Merapi]] is Indonesia's most active volcano with 112 recorded eruptions. Merapi's characteristic eruption style involves the growth and collapse of viscous lava domes, generating deadly pyroclastic flows known locally as *wedhus gembel* (\"shaggy goats\"). The 2010 VEI 4 eruption killed 367 people and forced the evacuation of 350,000 residents. More than 3 million people live within Merapi's hazard zone, making it one of the [[ranking:most-active-volcanoes|most active and dangerous volcanoes]] on Earth.\n\n**Krakatau** — The name [[volcano:krakatau|Krakatau]] is synonymous with volcanic catastrophe. The VEI 6 eruption of August 27, 1883 destroyed two-thirds of the original island, generated tsunamis up to 30 m high that killed more than 36,000 people, and produced a pressure wave that circled the globe multiple times. The explosion was heard 4,800 km (2,983 mi) away in Rodrigues Island near Mauritius. A new island, Anak Krakatau (\"Child of Krakatau\"), emerged from the caldera in 1927 and remains highly active — its December 2018 flank collapse triggered a tsunami that killed 437 people along the Sunda Strait coastline.\n\n**Tambora** — [[volcano:tambora|Mount Tambora]] on Sumbawa island produced the largest eruption in recorded human history in April 1815. The VEI 7 blast ejected approximately 50 km³ of magma, reduced the volcano's height from an estimated 4,300 m to 2,850 m (9,350 ft), killed an estimated 71,000–92,000 people directly and through famine, and injected so much sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere that 1816 became known globally as the \"Year Without a Summer.\" Tambora remains the benchmark against which all other historic eruptions are measured, and the only confirmed VEI 7 event of the past millennium alongside the 1257 Samalas eruption.\n\n**Semeru** — At 3,657 m (11,998 ft), [[volcano:semeru|Semeru]] is the tallest volcano on Java and one of Indonesia's most persistently active, with 66 recorded eruptions. Its Mahameru summit has been in near-continuous eruption since 1967, producing ash plumes and occasional pyroclastic flows. A devastating eruption in December 2021 sent pyroclastic flows 11 km down the Besuk Kobokan river valley, killing at least 51 people and destroying the village of Sumberwuluh.\n\n**Agung** — [[volcano:agung|Mount Agung]] (2,997 m / 9,833 ft) is Bali's highest peak and holiest mountain, home to the Pura Besakih mother temple complex. The catastrophic 1963 VEI 5 eruption killed over 1,100 people through pyroclastic flows and lahars, and its ash cloud disrupted aviation across the region. Agung reawakened in late 2017, causing the evacuation of 140,000 people and the closure of Ngurah Rai International Airport, before settling into intermittent eruptions through 2019.\n\n**Kelud** — Known for its violent and sudden eruptions, [[volcano:kelud|Kelud]] in East Java has produced 40 recorded eruptions with a maximum VEI of 5. Its crater lake has historically amplified eruption hazards by generating catastrophic lahars — the 1919 eruption killed over 5,000 people when hot volcanic material displaced the lake water. The February 2014 VEI 4 eruption ejected an ash column to 17 km altitude and shut down seven airports across Java.\n\n**Sinabung** — After roughly 400 years of dormancy, [[volcano:sinabung|Sinabung]] on Sumatra burst back to life in 2010 and has remained intermittently active ever since. The protracted eruption sequence from 2013–2019 produced multiple deadly pyroclastic flows (killing 23 people in February 2014 and 7 in May 2016) and displaced more than 30,000 people from surrounding villages. Sinabung's reawakening serves as a stark reminder that long-dormant Indonesian volcanoes can become active with devastating speed.\n\n**Rinjani** — [[volcano:rinjani|Mount Rinjani]] (3,726 m / 12,224 ft) on Lombok is Indonesia's second-tallest volcano and the source of the catastrophic 1257 Samalas eruption — a VEI 7 event now recognized as one of the largest eruptions of the past 10,000 years. The eruption destroyed the Lombok Kingdom, deposited ash across Southeast Asia, and may have contributed to global cooling that triggered the onset of the Little Ice Age. Today, Rinjani's massive Segara Anak caldera lake and stunning crater rim make it one of Indonesia's premier trekking destinations.\n\n**Gamalama** — The [[volcano:gamalama|Gamalama]] volcano (1,714 m / 5,623 ft) on Ternate Island in the Maluku province is one of Indonesia's most frequently active volcanoes with 84 recorded eruptions — the second-highest count in the country. The town of Ternate, once the center of the global spice trade, sits directly on Gamalama's lower flanks. Eruptions are typically mild (VEI 1–2) but occur with remarkable frequency.\n\n**Dukono** — [[volcano:dukono|Dukono]] on Halmahera island has been in near-continuous eruption since 1933, making it one of the longest-running eruptions on Earth. Its persistent low-level ash emissions frequently disrupt regional aviation. Despite its constant activity, Dukono's eruptions are generally small (VEI 1–2), though it produced a deadly VEI 3 eruption in 1550 that destroyed multiple villages.\n\n**Ibu** — [[volcano:ibu|Ibu]] volcano on Halmahera has become one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes in the 21st century. After its first confirmed historical eruption in 1911, it resumed activity in 1998 and has been in near-continuous eruption since, producing frequent ash plumes and occasional lava dome growth. In 2024–2025, Ibu escalated to produce larger explosions and pyroclastic flows, prompting multiple evacuations."

    "eruption_history": {
      "content": "Indonesia's eruption record spans more than 10,000 years and includes 1,472 eruptions documented in the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program database — the highest national total of any country and approximately 13% of all recorded eruptions worldwide. The archipelago's volcanic history includes two confirmed VEI 7 events: the 1257 eruption of Samalas (Mount Rinjani), which ejected an estimated 40 km³ of dense rock equivalent and is increasingly recognized as one of the triggers of the Little Ice Age; and the 1815 eruption of [[volcano:tambora|Tambora]], which remains the largest and [[ranking:deadliest-eruptions|deadliest eruption]] in recorded history. The 1883 VEI 6 eruption of [[volcano:krakatau|Krakatau]] ranks among the most famous natural disasters in human history, killing over 36,000 people primarily through tsunamis and producing atmospheric effects observed worldwide. Indonesia's eruption frequency has accelerated dramatically in the observational record: the 19th century saw 435 recorded eruptions, the 20th century 626, and the first quarter of the 21st century already 192. While part of this increase reflects improved monitoring rather than actual volcanic intensification, it underscores the extraordinary level of volcanic activity that Indonesians live with daily. Major eruptions in recent decades include Agung 1963 (VEI 5, 1,100+ deaths), Galunggung 1982 (VEI 4, nearly brought down a British Airways Boeing 747), Merapi 2010 (VEI 4, 367 deaths), Kelud 2014 (VEI 4, seven airports closed), Sinabung 2013–2019 (prolonged dome-building crisis), Semeru 2021 (51 deaths from pyroclastic flows), and Anak Krakatau's 2018 flank collapse and tsunami (437 deaths). In any given year, 5–15 Indonesian volcanoes are typically in eruption or at elevated alert levels, making the country's volcano monitoring challenge unparalleled."

    "volcanic_hazards": {
      "content": "Indonesia faces the full spectrum of volcanic hazards, amplified by extreme population density on volcanic slopes and the sheer number of simultaneously active volcanoes. Pyroclastic flows — superheated avalanches of gas, ash, and rock traveling at speeds up to 700 km/h (435 mph) at temperatures exceeding 400°C — are the primary killer, responsible for the majority of volcanic fatalities in the country. Merapi, Semeru, and Sinabung have all produced deadly pyroclastic flows in the 21st century. Lahars (volcanic mudflows) are an equally severe hazard, particularly in Indonesia's tropical climate where heavy rainfall mobilizes loose volcanic deposits. The 1919 Kelud lahar killed over 5,000 people. Volcanic tsunamis represent a uniquely Indonesian hazard: the 1883 Krakatau eruption generated 30 m tsunamis across the Sunda Strait, while the 2018 Anak Krakatau flank collapse demonstrated that even moderate eruptions can trigger lethal ocean waves without seismic warning. Ashfall regularly disrupts aviation across the archipelago; Indonesia's Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre monitors ash clouds from dozens of erupting volcanoes simultaneously. Toxic gas emissions from volcanic lakes and fumaroles have caused mass casualties — in 1979, a phreatic eruption at the Dieng Volcanic Complex released CO₂ that killed 149 people. Indonesia's PVMBG (Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation) operates a four-level alert system across all active volcanoes, maintaining networks of seismometers, tiltmeters, GPS stations, and visual observation posts. Despite these efforts, the challenge of monitoring 73+ active volcanoes with limited resources across a vast archipelago means that some eruptions — particularly at remote or long-dormant volcanoes — can occur with minimal warning."
    },
    "volcanic_zones_map": {
      "content": "Indonesia's 101 Holocene volcanoes are distributed across four major volcanic arc systems, each reflecting a distinct tectonic subduction geometry. The Sunda Volcanic Arc — by far the largest — accounts for 71 volcanoes stretching 3,000 km from the Andaman Sea through Sumatra (25 volcanoes), Java (22 volcanoes), Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, and the Lesser Sunda Islands. The Sunda Arc follows the subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate and includes Indonesia's most famous and dangerous volcanoes: Krakatau in the Sunda Strait, Merapi and Semeru on Java, Agung on Bali, Tambora on Sumbawa, and Kelimutu on Flores. East of the Sunda Arc, the tectonic geometry fractures into the complex Banda Arc, which curves through the Inner Banda Sea with 6 volcanoes including Banda Api and Serua. North of this zone, the Sangihe Volcanic Arc (11 volcanoes) runs north from Sulawesi toward the Philippines, while the Halmahera Volcanic Arc (13 volcanoes) faces it from the east — a rare configuration of opposing arcs produced by double subduction of the Molucca Sea Plate. The densest volcanic concentration is on Java, where 22 volcanoes are packed onto an island of 129,000 km² inhabited by 150 million people — the most volcanically exposed population on Earth."
    },
    "impact_on_culture_and_economy": {
      "content": "Volcanoes are inseparable from Indonesian life, culture, and economy. The fertile volcanic soils — renewed by centuries of ashfall and lava weathering — support some of the most productive agricultural land on the planet, enabling Java to sustain population densities exceeding 1,100 people per km². Rice paddies climb the flanks of active volcanoes, and coffee from volcanic highlands (including the famous Kopi Luwak from the slopes of volcanoes like Ijen) commands premium global prices. In Javanese and Balinese cosmology, volcanoes are sacred places where the physical and spiritual worlds meet. [[volcano:agung|Mount Agung]] is the holiest mountain in Balinese Hinduism, home to the Pura Besakih temple complex; [[volcano:merapi|Merapi]] has a spiritual gatekeeper (juru kunci) who performs annual offerings to appease the volcano's spirit. The Javanese concept of *kejawen* — a syncretic spiritual tradition — places volcanoes at the center of the island's cosmic geography. Indonesia's geothermal resources, generated by volcanic heat, provide approximately 2,356 MW of installed capacity — the second-highest in the world after the United States — with the potential for over 28,000 MW. Volcanic tourism is a growing economic sector: Bromo–Tengger–Semeru National Park receives over 600,000 visitors annually, Ijen's electric-blue sulfur flames attract thousands of photographers, and Rinjani's caldera trek is considered one of Southeast Asia's finest hiking experiences."

    "visiting_volcanoes": {
      "content": "Indonesia offers some of the world's most spectacular and accessible volcanic landscapes. [[volcano:tengger-caldera|Bromo]] (Tengger Caldera) in East Java is the most visited, famous for sunrise viewings from Penanjakan over a surreal sea-of-sand caldera containing multiple active cones — easily reached from Surabaya or Malang. [[volcano:ijen|Ijen]] in easternmost Java draws visitors for its turquoise acid crater lake and the otherworldly blue flames of burning sulfuric gases visible at night; independent sulfur miners still carry 70 kg loads from the crater floor. [[volcano:rinjani|Rinjani]] on Lombok offers a challenging 2–4 day trek to the crater rim at 3,726 m, rewarding hikers with views of the Segara Anak caldera lake and the active Barujari cone. On Bali, [[volcano:batur|Batur]] is the most accessible volcano, with sunrise treks organized from Kintamani. [[volcano:agung|Agung]] offers a more demanding climb, typically starting at midnight for a dawn summit. On Sumatra, [[volcano:sinabung|Sinabung]] and [[volcano:kerinci|Kerinci]] attract adventurous trekkers — Kerinci, at 3,800 m, is the highest volcano in Sumatra and can be climbed in 2–3 days from Kersik Tua. Always check PVMBG alert levels before visiting any Indonesian volcano; eruptions can escalate rapidly and restricted zones are enforced. The best trekking season is April–October (dry season), though volcanic conditions may override seasonal considerations."

    "The 1883 Krakatau eruption produced the loudest sound in modern history, audible 4,800 km (2,983 mi) away on Rodrigues Island near Mauritius, and generated a pressure wave that circled the globe at least four times.",
    "The 1257 eruption of Samalas (Mount Rinjani) is now recognized as one of the largest eruptions of the past 10,000 years at VEI 7, and may have helped trigger the Little Ice Age that lasted until the 19th century.",
    "Java — home to 22 active volcanoes — is the most densely populated large island on Earth with over 150 million people, creating the highest volcanic risk exposure of any region worldwide.",
    "Indonesia's 1,472 recorded eruptions account for approximately 13% of all eruptions in the entire Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program database.",
    "Anak Krakatau ('Child of Krakatau') emerged from the sea in 1927 within the 1883 caldera and has been growing ever since, though its 2018 flank collapse reduced its height from 338 m to approximately 110 m overnight.",
    "Indonesia has the second-largest installed geothermal power capacity in the world at approximately 2,356 MW, with an estimated untapped potential exceeding 28,000 MW — all generated by volcanic heat.",

    "Mount Merapi's 112 recorded eruptions make it the most frequently erupting volcano in Indonesia, and its dome-collapse pyroclastic flows have been studied so extensively that the collapse mechanism is named after it ('Merapi-type' pyroclastic flows).",
    "During the 1982 Galunggung eruption, British Airways Flight 9 flew through the ash cloud at 37,000 ft, all four engines flamed out, and the aircraft glided powerlessly for 16 minutes before pilots restarted the engines — an event that revolutionized volcanic ash aviation safety protocols worldwide.",

      "question": "How many volcanoes are in Indonesia?",
      "answer": "Indonesia has 101 Holocene volcanoes catalogued by the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program, of which 73 have observed historical eruptions — the highest count of historically active volcanoes of any nation. Different sources cite varying numbers because of how 'volcano' is defined: the Smithsonian counts only volcanoes with evidence of eruption within the last 11,700 years (the Holocene epoch), while PVMBG, Indonesia's national monitoring agency, identifies 127 active volcanoes using slightly different criteria. The discrepancy arises because some volcanic centers are grouped differently (e.g., Java's Tengger Caldera includes Bromo as a sub-feature) and because geological evidence of activity is continuously being refined."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many active volcanoes are in Indonesia?",
      "answer": "Indonesia has 73 volcanoes with historically observed eruptions, and at any given time between 5 and 15 are typically erupting or showing elevated unrest. The term 'active' is defined differently by different agencies: PVMBG considers 127 volcanoes active, while the Smithsonian classifies 73 as having 'eruption observed' evidence. Indonesia averages over 50 eruptions per decade, far more than any other country. In 2025 alone, volcanoes including Semeru, Ibu, Merapi, Dukono, Lewotolok, Dempo, Raung, and Lewotobi have all been in states of eruption or heightened activity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the tallest volcano in Indonesia?",
      "answer": "Kerinci is the tallest volcano in Indonesia at 3,800 m (12,467 ft), located on the island of Sumatra within Kerinci Seblat National Park — the largest national park in Sumatra. Kerinci is an active stratovolcano with 39 recorded eruptions, most recently in 2024, and is also the highest peak in Sumatra. The second-tallest is Rinjani on Lombok at 3,726 m (12,224 ft), followed by Semeru on Java at 3,657 m (11,998 ft), which is the tallest volcano on Java. All three are popular trekking destinations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What was Indonesia's worst volcanic eruption?",
      "answer": "The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on Sumbawa island was the deadliest and most powerful eruption in Indonesia's recorded history — and the largest eruption anywhere in the world since at least 1257. The VEI 7 explosion on April 10, 1815 ejected approximately 50 km³ of magma, sent an eruption column more than 40 km into the stratosphere, and reduced Tambora's summit from an estimated 4,300 m to 2,850 m. An estimated 71,000–92,000 people died from the eruption and its aftermath, including from pyroclastic flows, tsunami, and widespread famine caused by crop failure across the Indonesian archipelago and globally during the 1816 'Year Without a Summer.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Indonesia have so many volcanoes?",
      "answer": "Indonesia has an extraordinary concentration of volcanoes because it sits at the intersection of three major tectonic plate boundaries within the Ring of Fire. The Indo-Australian Plate subducts beneath the Eurasian Plate along the Sunda Arc, generating the chain of volcanoes running from Sumatra through Java and into the Lesser Sunda Islands. In the Maluku region, a rare double subduction zone creates two opposing volcanic arcs (Sangihe and Halmahera). Additionally, the collision of the Pacific Plate and Philippine Sea Plate to the northeast adds further volcanic activity. This convergence of multiple subduction zones across a 5,100 km archipelago produces the densest concentration of active volcanism on the planet."
    },
    {
      "question": "When was the last volcanic eruption in Indonesia?",
      "answer": "Indonesia has multiple volcanoes in eruption at any given time, making the question of 'last eruption' somewhat different than for most countries. As of 2025, volcanoes actively erupting include Semeru, Ibu, Merapi, Dukono, Lewotolok, and Dempo, among others. Significant recent eruptions include the April 2024 eruption of Ruang (VEI 4), which forced the complete evacuation of Ruang Island; the November 2024 eruption of Lewotobi in Flores that killed 10 people; and the continuing eruption of Ibu on Halmahera that has escalated through 2024–2025 with explosive events and pyroclastic flows."

      "question": "Is it safe to visit volcanoes in Indonesia?",
      "answer": "Visiting Indonesian volcanoes is generally safe provided travelers check current PVMBG alert levels (Levels I–IV, from Normal to Awas/Danger) and respect exclusion zones. Popular volcanoes like Bromo (Tengger Caldera), Batur on Bali, and Ijen on Java have well-established tourist infrastructure and guides. Rinjani and Kerinci are more challenging treks requiring guides and permits. Never enter restricted zones around active volcanoes at Level III (Siaga) or Level IV (Awas). Air quality can deteriorate rapidly during eruptions — carry a mask. The dry season (April–October) offers the best trekking conditions. Always hire a local guide for summit attempts, and register with national park authorities where required."

      "question": "What is the most dangerous volcano in Indonesia?",
      "answer": "Mount Merapi in Central Java is widely considered Indonesia's most dangerous volcano, combining extreme eruption frequency (112 recorded eruptions, the highest in the country), a propensity for explosive dome-collapse pyroclastic flows, and proximity to approximately 3 million people — including the major city of Yogyakarta just 28 km away. However, Krakatau poses a unique tsunami threat to the densely populated Sunda Strait coastline, and long-dormant volcanoes like Tambora and Rinjani have the potential for catastrophic VEI 6–7 eruptions. Indonesia's overall volcanic danger is distributed: with 73 historically active volcanoes and limited monitoring resources, any of dozens of volcanoes could produce a lethal eruption."

      "question": "What happened during the 1883 Krakatau eruption?",
      "answer": "The eruption of Krakatau on August 26–27, 1883 was one of the most catastrophic volcanic events in modern history. After months of escalating activity, the volcano produced four enormous explosions on August 27, the third of which — at 10:02 AM local time — was the loudest sound in recorded history, heard 4,800 km away. Two-thirds of the original Krakatau island collapsed into the emptied magma chamber, generating tsunamis up to 30 m high that devastated coastal towns across the Sunda Strait and killed more than 36,000 people. The eruption injected massive amounts of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, lowering global temperatures by an average of 1.2°C and producing vivid red sunsets observed worldwide for months."

      "question": "How does Indonesia monitor its volcanoes?",
      "answer": "Indonesia's Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG), under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, monitors all active volcanoes through a nationwide network of over 500 seismic stations, tiltmeters, GPS instruments, and gas sensors. Each major volcano has a dedicated observation post (pos pengamatan) staffed 24 hours. PVMBG uses a four-level alert system: Level I (Normal), Level II (Waspada/Advisory), Level III (Siaga/Watch), and Level IV (Awas/Warning). Satellite remote sensing, InSAR deformation monitoring, and thermal imaging supplement ground-based networks. Despite these capabilities, the challenge of monitoring 73+ active volcanoes across an archipelago spanning three time zones means some eruptions at remote volcanoes can still occur with limited advance warning."
