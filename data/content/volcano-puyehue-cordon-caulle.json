    "overview": {
      "content": "Puyehue-Cordón Caulle (PCCVC) is a large volcanic complex in the southern Chilean Andes, located in the Los Ríos Region approximately 100 km (62 mi) east of the city of Osorno and southeast of Lago Ranco. The complex consists of three main components: the 1,799 m Pleistocene Cordillera Nevada caldera at the northwest end, the Cordón Caulle fissure complex in the center, and the 2,236 m (7,336 ft) Puyehue <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> at the southeast end. With 26 recorded eruptions spanning over 7,000 years — including three VEI 5 events — the PCCVC is one of the most powerful volcanic systems in <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-chile\">Chile's</a> Southern Volcanic Zone. The Cordón Caulle fissure system, occupying a 6 × 13 km volcano-tectonic depression, is the largest active geothermal area in the southern Andes and has been the source of all significant historical eruptions — including events previously attributed to Puyehue itself (notably the major eruptions of 1921–22 and 1960). The complex gained global attention on June 4, 2011, when a VEI 5 eruption from the Cordón Caulle produced a massive rhyolitic eruption column that sent ash around the Southern Hemisphere, disrupting air travel across South America, Australia, and New Zealand for weeks. The eruption also produced a rare rhyolitic lava flow — an unusual phenomenon that provided volcanologists with a natural laboratory for studying the behavior of viscous silicic lava. The complex sits within Puyehue National Park, one of Chile's oldest protected areas, known for its hot springs, Araucaria forests, and volcanic landscapes. The PCCVC's geochemical diversity — ranging from basalt to rhyolite — makes it the most compositionally varied volcanic system in the southern Andes, reflecting a complex magmatic plumbing system fed by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the <a href=\"/ring-of-fire\">South American Plate</a>."
    },
    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "The Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic complex is driven by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate along the Peru-Chile Trench. It sits within the Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) of the Andes, a segment of the volcanic arc characterized by thick continental crust (>25 km) and a wide range of magma compositions. The complex represents a NW-SE-trending volcanic chain of late Pleistocene to Holocene age. The Cordillera Nevada caldera at the northwestern end is the oldest major structure — a Pleistocene collapse feature now heavily glaciated. The Cordón Caulle fissure system occupies a 6 × 13 km volcano-tectonic depression between Cordillera Nevada and Puyehue, and represents a graben-like extensional zone where magma reaches the surface through a network of fissures rather than a single central conduit. Puyehue stratovolcano at the southeastern end is a flat-topped, 2,236 m cone built above a 5 km-wide caldera and capped by a 2.4 km-wide Holocene summit caldera. Lava flows and domes of mostly rhyolitic composition are found on its eastern flank. The PCCVC is the most geochemically diverse volcanic system in the southern Andes, producing magmas ranging from basalt to rhyolite. The rhyolitic character of the 2011 eruption — and of several Holocene eruptions — distinguishes the complex from most SVZ volcanoes, which typically erupt andesitic to dacitic magma. The NE-adjacent Pleistocene Mencheca volcano with Holocene flank cones adds additional complexity to the system."

    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "The PCCVC has 26 recorded eruptions in the Smithsonian database, spanning from approximately 5080 BCE to 2012. Three eruptions have reached VEI 5: ~5080 BCE (from Puyehue), ~860 CE (from Puyehue), and 2011 (from Cordón Caulle). The pre-historical record is dominated by large explosive events, while the historical record (from 1759 onward) includes a mix of moderate explosive eruptions (VEI 2–3) and the major 2011 event. The Cordón Caulle fissure system has been the source of all well-documented historical eruptions, and several eruptions originally attributed to Puyehue (including the 1921–22 and 1960 events) are now understood to have originated from the fissure zone. The complex was notably active in the early 20th century, with eruptions in 1893, 1905, 1914, 1919–1920, 1921–1922, 1929, and 1934 — all from Cordón Caulle. After the 1960 eruption (triggered by the Great Chilean Earthquake), the complex was relatively quiet until the dramatic 2011 event."

          "content": "Around 860 CE, a major VEI 5 eruption from the Puyehue stratovolcano produced voluminous pumice deposits across the southern Chilean and Argentine landscapes. This event was the most powerful eruption from the Puyehue cone itself (as opposed to the Cordón Caulle fissures) in the Holocene record, and its tephra serves as a key stratigraphic marker in regional geological studies. The eruption likely produced pyroclastic flows, heavy ashfall, and lahars draining into Lago Ranco and other nearby lakes."

The eruption, originally attributed to Puyehue, generated significant explosive activity and lava flows from the fissure zone.

The eruption was almost certainly triggered by the earthquake, which caused massive crustal deformation across the region. The eruption produced explosive activity and lava flows from the fissure zone. The coincidence of the world's largest recorded earthquake and a significant volcanic eruption made this event a landmark case study in earthquake-volcano interaction, providing some of the strongest evidence that large tectonic earthquakes can trigger eruptions at nearby volcanoes."

The eruption began with a Plinian column that rose to approximately 12–14 km altitude, injecting rhyolitic ash and pumice into the atmosphere. The ash cloud circled the Southern Hemisphere, disrupting air travel across Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand over a period of weeks. Flights were cancelled across the region, and the Buenos Aires airports were repeatedly closed. As the eruption continued through late 2011 and into early 2012, it transitioned from explosive to effusive, producing a remarkable rhyolitic lava flow — a rare phenomenon because rhyolitic magma is typically too viscous to flow significant distances. The 2011 lava flow advanced slowly across the Cordón Caulle landscape, providing volcanologists with an unprecedented opportunity to study the emplacement of rhyolitic lava in real time. Total erupted volume was estimated at approximately 1 km³ dense-rock equivalent (DRE). The eruption caused significant economic damage to the Chilean and Argentine Lake District tourism economies and agricultural sectors due to ashfall."

    "current_status_and_monitoring": {
      "content": "Puyehue-Cordón Caulle is classified as active and is monitored by SERNAGEOMIN (Servicio Nacional de Geología y Minería), Chile's geological survey, through its OVDAS (Observatorio Volcanológico de los Andes del Sur) network. The monitoring infrastructure includes seismometers, GPS/GNSS stations, webcams, and satellite remote sensing. Following the 2011–2012 eruption, the complex returned to a state of background seismicity and fumarolic activity in the Cordón Caulle geothermal area. The thermal anomaly associated with the 2011 lava flow cooled gradually over several years but remained detectable by satellite for an extended period. Given the complex's history of clustered eruptions (particularly the early 20th century sequence of seven eruptions between 1893 and 1934), volcanologists maintain ongoing surveillance for signs of renewed unrest. The recurrence interval for VEI 5 eruptions at the PCCVC is poorly constrained but averages roughly 1,000–2,000 years based on the three known events (~5080 BCE, ~860 CE, 2011 CE)."
    },
    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "The PCCVC poses hazards at both local and hemispheric scales. Locally, eruptions can produce pyroclastic flows, lava flows, heavy ashfall, and lahars — the latter particularly dangerous because the complex's drainage feeds into Lago Ranco and other lakes and rivers in the Chilean Lake District. Approximately 10,000 people live in communities within range of direct volcanic hazards, including areas along the access roads to Puyehue National Park and the Huilo-Huilo private reserve. Ashfall from VEI 3+ eruptions can affect the cities of Osorno (~170,000) and Valdivia (~170,000). At the hemispheric scale, the 2011 eruption demonstrated that VEI 5 events at the PCCVC can disrupt air travel across the entire Southern Hemisphere — an economic impact extending far beyond Chile. The complex's rhyolitic magma is particularly hazardous: rhyolitic eruptions tend to be more explosive than andesitic ones, and the fine-grained ash they produce stays suspended in the atmosphere longer and travels farther. Compared to other Southern Volcanic Zone volcanoes, the PCCVC's threat profile is amplified by its proven capacity for VEI 5 eruptions and its rhyolitic magma composition."

    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "The Puyehue-Cordón Caulle complex stretches approximately 20 km along a NW-SE axis in the southern Chilean Andes, within the Los Ríos Region. The flat-topped Puyehue stratovolcano (2,236 m) at the southeastern end is capped by a 2.4 km-wide summit caldera and flanked by rhyolitic lava domes. The Cordón Caulle fissure system occupies the central 6 × 13 km depression — a vast, treeless landscape of volcanic vents, steaming fumaroles, hot springs, and obsidian flows. The Cordillera Nevada caldera (1,799 m) at the northwestern end is heavily glaciated. The complex lies within Puyehue National Park, surrounded by temperate rainforest dominated by southern beech (Nothofagus) and, at higher elevations, Araucaria (monkey puzzle) trees. To the west, the landscape drops steeply toward the Chilean Lake District lowlands; to the east, the Argentine border is only about 10 km away, and ashfall from eruptions frequently crosses into the Argentine province of Neuquén. The Aguas Calientes hot springs at the base of the complex are a popular tourist attraction and attest to the vigorous geothermal system beneath the Cordón Caulle."

    "climate_and_global_impact": {
      "content": "The 2011 VEI 5 eruption of Cordón Caulle had significant regional atmospheric impact, with the ash cloud circling the Southern Hemisphere and disrupting air travel for weeks across South America, Australasia, and parts of Africa. However, the eruption's climate impact was modest compared to larger historical eruptions. The estimated ~1 km³ DRE volume and ~12–14 km eruption column height placed the 2011 event near the lower boundary of eruptions capable of injecting aerosols into the stratosphere at high southern latitudes. No measurable global temperature anomaly was attributed to the eruption. The pre-historical VEI 5 eruptions (~5080 BCE and ~860 CE) may have had more significant regional climate effects, but these predate instrumental records. For comparison, the 1991 eruption of <a href=\"/volcano/pinatubo\">Pinatubo</a> (VEI 6) — roughly ten times more voluminous — cooled global temperatures by approximately 0.5°C."

    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "Puyehue-Cordón Caulle lies within one of Chile's premier natural heritage areas. Puyehue National Park, established in 1941, is one of the country's oldest protected areas and draws visitors for its hot springs (Termas de Puyehue, Aguas Calientes), Araucaria forests, skiing (Antillanca ski resort), and volcanic landscapes. The 2011 eruption had a profound impact on the regional economy: the Chilean and Argentine Lake District tourism industries suffered significant losses as ashfall covered resort towns on both sides of the border, and the agricultural sector was affected by ash contamination of pastures and water supplies. The eruption and its aftermath became a defining event for the communities of the Lake District, analogous to the impact of the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption on European aviation. In the Mapuche indigenous tradition, volcanoes in the region are regarded as powerful spiritual entities, and the 2011 eruption reinforced the cultural significance of volcanic landscapes in southern <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-chile\">Chile</a>."

    "visiting_and_tourism": {
      "content": "Puyehue National Park offers extensive visitor infrastructure, with the Aguas Calientes hot springs complex (approximately 70 km east of Osorno via Route 215) serving as the primary base. The park features hiking trails through temperate rainforest, hot spring pools, and access to the Antillanca ski resort on the upper flanks of the complex. The Cordón Caulle fissure zone itself is a more remote destination requiring multi-hour hikes through rugged volcanic terrain, and access may be restricted during periods of volcanic unrest. The 2011 lava flow is an increasingly popular destination for volcanology enthusiasts. The area is accessible year-round, though winter (June–September) brings heavy snowfall at higher elevations. The Termas de Puyehue resort, located outside the park boundary, offers upscale hot spring accommodations. Visitors should check SERNAGEOMIN volcanic alerts before venturing into the upper reaches of the complex."

    "etymology": {
      "content": "'Puyehue' is derived from the Mapudungun language of the Mapuche people and is believed to mean 'place of small fish' or 'place of the puye' (a small native fish, Galaxias maculatus). 'Cordón Caulle' translates from Spanish as 'Caulle Ridge' or 'Caulle Range' — 'cordón' meaning ridge or chain, and 'Caulle' being a local place name. The combined name reflects the dual nature of the volcanic system: a classical stratovolcano (Puyehue) linked to a fissure rift zone (Cordón Caulle)."

      "answer": "On June 4, 2011, the Cordón Caulle fissure system erupted explosively in a VEI 5 event, producing a Plinian column that rose to 12–14 km altitude and injected rhyolitic ash into the atmosphere. The ash cloud circled the Southern Hemisphere, disrupting air travel across South America, Australia, and New Zealand for weeks. As the eruption progressed, it transitioned to producing a rare rhyolitic lava flow. Total erupted volume was approximately 1 km³ DRE. The eruption caused significant economic damage to the Chilean and Argentine Lake District."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of volcano is Puyehue-Cordón Caulle?",
      "answer": "The PCCVC is a complex volcanic system consisting of the Puyehue stratovolcano, the Cordón Caulle fissure complex, and the Cordillera Nevada caldera. The Cordón Caulle is a 6 × 13 km volcano-tectonic depression (graben) where eruptions occur from a network of fissures rather than a single central vent. The system produces magma ranging from basalt to rhyolite — the widest compositional range of any volcanic system in Chile's Southern Volcanic Zone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was the 1960 eruption caused by an earthquake?",
      "answer": "Yes, the 1960 Cordón Caulle eruption is widely considered to have been triggered by the magnitude 9.5 Great Chilean Earthquake of May 22, 1960 — the most powerful earthquake ever recorded. The eruption began just 38 hours after the earthquake. The seismic shaking likely destabilized the volcanic system's magma reservoir or opened pathways for magma ascent. This remains one of the best-documented cases of earthquake-triggered volcanism."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you visit Puyehue-Cordón Caulle?",
      "answer": "Yes, Puyehue National Park offers extensive visitor facilities including hot springs (Aguas Calientes), hiking trails, and the Antillanca ski resort. The Cordón Caulle fissure zone is accessible via multi-hour hikes through rugged terrain. The 2011 lava flow is an increasingly popular destination. The area is accessible year-round, approximately 70 km east of Osorno via Route 215. Visitors should check SERNAGEOMIN alerts before venturing into the upper volcanic area."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall is Puyehue-Cordón Caulle?",
      "answer": "Puyehue stratovolcano, the highest point of the complex, stands at 2,236 m (7,336 ft) above sea level. The Cordón Caulle fissure zone is somewhat lower, and the Cordillera Nevada caldera reaches 1,799 m. For comparison, other major volcanoes in Chile's Lake District include Osorno (2,652 m), Villarrica (2,847 m), and Calbuco (2,003 m)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often does Puyehue-Cordón Caulle erupt?",
      "answer": "The complex has produced 26 eruptions over approximately 7,000 years. However, eruption frequency is highly variable: the complex erupted seven times between 1893 and 1934, then was relatively quiet until 1960, then quiet again until the major 2011 event. VEI 5 eruptions have occurred roughly every 1,000–2,000 years (three in the Holocene). Smaller eruptions (VEI 2–3) have been more frequent but irregularly spaced."
