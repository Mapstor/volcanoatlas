      "content": "Kelud (also commonly spelled Kelut) is an active <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> rising to 1,730 m (5,676 ft) in East Java, <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-indonesia\">Indonesia</a>, approximately 90 km southwest of Surabaya, the country's second-largest city. Despite its relatively inconspicuous profile, Kelud ranks among the most dangerous and historically deadly volcanoes in Indonesia, having killed more than 15,000 people across its recorded eruption history. The volcano's notoriety derives from its summit crater lake, which has repeatedly served as the source of catastrophic lahars when eruptions violently eject millions of cubic meters of superheated water. More than 30 eruptions have been documented since 1000 CE, and the volcano has produced at least 6 events at <a href=\"/volcanic-explosivity-index\">VEI 4</a> or higher, including a VEI 5 eruption in 1586. The combination of violent, short-duration eruptions, lahar-prone topography, and a densely populated surrounding landscape — over 5 million people live within 30 km — makes Kelud one of Indonesia's highest-priority volcanoes for monitoring and hazard mitigation. The volcano's eruption history has directly shaped Indonesian volcanic engineering, prompting the construction of drainage tunnels to reduce the crater lake's volume — a pioneering effort in volcanic risk reduction. Kelud's most recent eruption in February 2014 produced a VEI 4 event that sent ash as far as Surabaya and Yogyakarta, grounded flights across Java, and demonstrated that the volcano remains a formidable threat despite engineering interventions."
    },
    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Kelud sits on the Sunda Volcanic Arc, generated by the northward subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate at approximately 6–7 cm per year. The volcano rises from the thick continental crust (>25 km) of the East Java back-arc region, producing andesitic to basaltic-andesitic magma that fuels its characteristically explosive eruptions. The summit complex consists of a cluster of lava domes cut by numerous craters, giving the upper edifice an irregular, rugged profile. Eruptive activity has migrated in a broadly clockwise direction around the summit vent complex over time, creating overlapping crater structures. Satellitic cones and lava domes also occur on the eastern, western, and south-southwest flanks. The volcano's most consequential geological feature has been its summit crater lake, which forms in the depression created by explosive eruptions and then serves as the raw material for devastating lahars during subsequent events. The interplay between magma, water, and steep topography is what makes Kelud so dangerous: phreatomagmatic explosions — triggered by the interaction of rising magma with the lake — instantaneously convert millions of cubic meters of water into superheated steam and scalding mudflows."
    },
    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "Kelud has produced at least 40 recorded eruptions dating back to approximately 230 BCE, with detailed historical records from 1000 CE onward. The volcano erupts in characteristically short, violent paroxysms rather than prolonged effusive episodes, often reaching peak intensity within hours and subsiding within days. At least 12 eruptions have reached VEI 3 or higher, and the volcano has generated multiple VEI 4 events (1641, 1826, 1919, 1951, 1966, 1990, and 2014) plus one VEI 5 (1586). The recurrence interval between major eruptions has historically averaged 15–30 years in the modern period, though clusters of activity have occurred. The cumulative death toll from Kelud's eruptions exceeds 15,000, primarily from lahars, making it one of the <a href=\"/deadliest-eruptions\">deadliest volcanoes</a> in recorded history."

The mudflows destroyed entire villages and killed 5,110 people, most within the river valleys draining the volcano. The catastrophe prompted the Dutch colonial government to commission drainage tunnels bored through the crater wall to permanently lower the lake level by more than 50 m."

Unlike previous eruptions, the crater lake had been largely displaced by a lava dome that grew during a 2007 eruption, so lahars were not the primary hazard. Instead, the 2014 eruption was a massive explosive event: a Plinian column rose to approximately 17 km (56,000 ft) altitude, spreading ash across Java from Surabaya to Yogyakarta — a distance of over 200 km. Seven international airports were temporarily closed. At least 7 people were killed, and over 100,000 were evacuated. The eruption completely destroyed the 2007 lava dome and reshaped the summit crater."

PVMBG monitors the volcano through seismic networks, GPS deformation measurements, gas sampling, and regular visual observations. The crater lake temperature and water level are tracked as key precursory indicators, since rising lake temperatures have historically preceded eruptions by weeks to months. The volcano's alert level remains at Normal (Level I) during quiescent periods but can be rapidly escalated. Given Kelud's average recurrence interval of approximately 15–30 years between major eruptions, volcanologists are monitoring closely for signs of magmatic recharge."

The volcano's dense population base — more than 5 million people within 30 km, including the cities of Kediri (~320,000) and Blitar (~150,000) — places enormous numbers of people at risk. River valleys draining the volcano act as channels for lahars that can travel tens of kilometers in minutes. The engineering response — drainage tunnels to reduce crater lake volume — has been partially effective but cannot eliminate the hazard entirely. PVMBG maintains exclusion zones and evacuation plans, but the logistical challenge of moving hundreds of thousands of people on short notice remains the central problem in Kelud risk management."

Multiple river valleys radiate outward from the summit, providing natural conduits for lahars. The crater lake, when present, occupies a shallow depression at the summit and has varied dramatically in size and depth following each eruption."

    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "Kelud holds a significant place in Javanese culture and history. Ancient Javanese texts reference the volcano's eruptions, and the name Kelud (or Kelut) derives from the Javanese word for 'swept,' referencing the devastating lahars that sweep clean the river valleys below. The volcanic soils around Kelud support some of the most productive agricultural land in Java, creating a paradox common to volcanic regions: the same force that periodically destroys also sustains the livelihoods of millions. The 1919 disaster and the subsequent Dutch engineering response represent a landmark in the history of volcanic hazard mitigation worldwide — one of the first large-scale attempts to physically alter a volcano's structure to reduce risk."

    {
      "question": "Is Kelud volcano still active?",
      "answer": "Yes, Kelud is classified as an active volcano. Its most recent eruption occurred on February 13, 2014, when a powerful VEI 4 explosive event sent ash across much of Java and closed seven airports. The volcano has produced more than 30 eruptions since 1000 CE and averages a major eruption every 15–30 years. PVMBG monitors Kelud continuously, tracking crater lake temperature and seismicity as key precursory indicators. Volcanologists consider future eruptions certain."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many people has Kelud killed?",
      "answer": "Kelud has killed more than 15,000 people across its recorded eruption history, making it one of Indonesia's deadliest volcanoes. The worst single event was the 1919 eruption, which killed 5,110 people through lahars generated by the explosive ejection of the crater lake. The 1586 VEI 5 eruption may have killed as many as 10,000. Other deadly events include 1966 (200+ deaths) and 1951 (7 deaths). The declining death toll partly reflects engineering interventions and improved early warning systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Kelud's eruptions so deadly?",
      "answer": "Kelud's lethality stems from the interaction between its explosive eruptions and the summit crater lake. When magma rises into the lake, it triggers phreatomagmatic explosions that instantaneously convert millions of cubic meters of water into superheated steam and scalding mudflows (lahars). These lahars race down river valleys at high speed, reaching populated lowlands kilometers away within minutes. The dense population base — over 5 million within 30 km — compounds the risk enormously."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happened in Kelud's 2014 eruption?",
      "answer": "On February 13, 2014, Kelud erupted in a VEI 4 explosive paroxysm that lasted only a few hours. A Plinian column rose to approximately 17 km (56,000 ft), spreading ash across Java from Surabaya to Yogyakarta. Seven international airports were closed, over 100,000 people were evacuated, and at least 7 people were killed. Unlike previous eruptions, lahars were not the primary hazard because a lava dome had displaced much of the crater lake. The eruption completely destroyed that dome."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall is Kelud volcano?",
      "answer": "Kelud stands at 1,730 m (5,676 ft) above sea level. This is relatively modest compared to other major Javanese volcanoes: Semeru reaches 3,657 m and Merapi 2,910 m. Kelud's relatively low profile belies its explosive power — its eruptions are driven by the violent interaction of magma with the crater lake rather than by the height of the volcanic edifice."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the drainage tunnels at Kelud?",
      "answer": "Following the 1919 eruption that killed 5,110 people, Dutch colonial engineers constructed drainage tunnels through the crater wall to permanently lower the crater lake level by over 50 m, reducing the volume of water available for lahar generation. This was one of the world's first large-scale volcanic engineering projects. Additional deeper tunnels were built after subsequent eruptions in 1951 and 1966. While the tunnels have reduced casualties, they cannot eliminate the hazard entirely."
    },
    {
      "question": "When will Kelud erupt next?",
      "answer": "No one can predict the exact timing of Kelud's next eruption, but the volcano's average recurrence interval of 15–30 years between major eruptions suggests another event is possible within the coming decades. The crater lake is gradually refilling since the 2014 eruption, slowly restoring the conditions for the lahar-generating eruption style that has made the volcano so deadly. PVMBG monitors crater lake temperature, seismicity, and ground deformation for signs of magmatic recharge."
