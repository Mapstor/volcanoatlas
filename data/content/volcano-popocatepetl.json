      "content": "Popocatépetl (Nahuatl: \"Smoking Mountain\"; Spanish pronunciation: [popokaˈtepetl]) is an active <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> in central <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-mexico\">Mexico</a>, rising to 5,393 m (17,694 ft) on the border of the states of Puebla, Morelos, and Mexico State, approximately 70 km (43 mi) southeast of Mexico City and 43 km (27 mi) west of the city of Puebla. It is the second-highest mountain in Mexico (after Pico de Orizaba at 5,636 m), North America's second-highest volcano, and one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world — with approximately 25 million people living within a 100 km (62 mi) radius of its summit, making it arguably the most population-exposed active volcano on Earth.\n\nPopocatépetl sits within the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, a 1,000 km (620 mi) chain of volcanoes stretching across central Mexico from the Pacific coast to the Gulf of Mexico, generated by the subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate. The generally symmetrical, glacier-clad cone contains a steep-walled summit crater measuring approximately 400 × 600 m (1,310 × 1,970 ft) that hosts a growing lava dome — a hallmark of the volcano's current eruptive phase, which began in 1994 and has included continuous dome-building, Vulcanian explosions, and ash emissions through 2025. With 46 recorded eruptions including at least two VEI 5 Plinian events, Popocatépetl has the explosive pedigree to generate catastrophic pyroclastic flows and lahars capable of reaching populated areas in the surrounding valleys.\n\nThe volcano dominates the Mexican landscape and national identity. Visible from both Mexico City and Puebla on clear days, Popocatépetl and its neighboring extinct volcano Iztaccíhuatl (5,230 m) form one of the most iconic mountain pairings in the Western Hemisphere, immortalized in Aztec legend as a warrior and his sleeping princess. The <a href=\"/ring-of-fire\">Ring of Fire</a> stratovolcano has been erupting intermittently since Pre-Columbian times, with activity first documented in Aztec codices, and its current restless state makes it one of the most closely monitored and most written-about volcanoes in the Americas."

    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Popocatépetl is constructed upon the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB), a geologically unusual volcanic arc that runs east–west across central Mexico at an oblique angle to the underlying Cocos Plate subduction zone — rather than parallel to the trench as in most subduction-generated arcs. This geometry results from the complex interaction between the subducting Cocos Plate, the Rivera Plate to the west, and the overriding North American Plate, combined with variations in subduction angle along the trench. The crustal thickness beneath Popocatépetl exceeds 25 km (16 mi), and the magma produced is predominantly andesitic to basaltic-andesitic in composition — intermediate-composition lavas characteristic of continental arc volcanism.\n\nThe volcanic complex has a long and destructive history. At least three previous major cones were destroyed by gravitational collapse during the Pleistocene, producing massive debris-avalanche deposits that cover broad areas to the south. These sector collapses are a critical hazard consideration: the deposits extend up to 60 km (37 mi) from the summit and buried what are now densely populated lowlands. The modern cone (sometimes called Popocatépetl sensu stricto) was constructed to the south of the late-Pleistocene to Holocene El Fraile cone, and most of the present-day edifice has been built within the last 23,000 years.\n\nThree major Plinian eruptions have occurred since the mid-Holocene. The most recent, around 800 CE, produced extensive pyroclastic flow deposits and voluminous lahars that swept basins below the volcano — an event that may have contributed to the decline of the nearby city of Cholula, then one of the largest urban centers in Mesoamerica. The two VEI 5 events, around 3700 BCE and 200 BCE, ejected large volumes of pumice and generated pyroclastic flows that traveled 20+ km (12+ mi) from the summit. The volcano's sharp-peaked remnant on the northwest flank, called Ventorrillo, is a surviving fragment of an older edifice that predates the current cone."

    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "Popocatépetl's eruption record is among the most extensive in the Western Hemisphere, with 46 confirmed eruptions in the Smithsonian GVP database spanning from approximately 7150 BCE to the present. This includes at least seven prehistoric eruptions (some reaching VEI 4–5), frequent activity during the Aztec and colonial periods (14th–17th centuries), a long quiet interval from the mid-17th to the late 19th century, and the current eruptive phase that reactivated in 1994 after 67 years of dormancy.\n\nThe pre-Columbian record is dominated by the three major Plinian eruptions of the Holocene: around 7150 BCE (VEI 4, from the El Fraile precursor cone), approximately 3700 BCE (VEI 5), and approximately 200 BCE (VEI 5). The most recent Plinian event, around 800 CE (VEI 4), deposited thick pumice layers across the surrounding region and is well-preserved in the geological record. Historical eruptions, first documented in Aztec codices beginning in 1345 CE, record frequent but generally modest explosive activity (VEI 1–3) throughout the 14th–17th centuries, with notable periods of heightened activity in 1345–1347, 1519–1523 (coinciding with the Spanish Conquest — Hernán Cortés and Bernal Díaz del Castillo both described the volcano's eruptions), and 1663–1665 (VEI 3).\n\nAfter a major eruption in 1697, Popocatépetl entered a period of gradually declining activity. Minor eruptions continued through the 19th and early 20th centuries (1802–1804, 1919–1922, 1923–1927, 1933, 1942–1943, 1947), but by the late 1920s the volcano was essentially dormant, with only fumarolic activity at the summit. This 67-year quiet period ended dramatically in December 1994."

          "title": "The Current Eruptive Phase (1994–Present) — Three Decades of Unrest",
          "content": "On December 21, 1994, Popocatépetl shattered its 67-year slumber with a series of phreatic (steam-driven) explosions that sent ash columns 3 km above the summit and dusted the cities of Puebla and Atlixco with fine ash. The reawakening prompted the evacuation of approximately 75,000 people from surrounding villages — the first major volcanic evacuation in modern Mexican history.\n\nThe initial 1994–1995 phase was followed by escalating activity: phreatomagmatic explosions, increasing seismicity, and the growth of a lava dome within the summit crater beginning in March 1996. The dome-building process has continued episodically for three decades, punctuated by Vulcanian explosions that destroy the dome, eject ballistic blocks to distances of 2–3 km, and generate ash columns reaching 5–10 km (16,000–33,000 ft) above the crater. The cycle of dome growth, pressurization, and explosive destruction has repeated hundreds of times.\n\nKey escalation events include: December 18–19, 2000, when a major explosive episode forced the evacuation of approximately 41,000 people and generated pyroclastic flows that traveled up to 6 km down the north flank (the first pyroclastic flows in the current eruptive phase); April–May 2012, when a major ash emission sent a plume 3 km above the summit and deposited ash on Puebla; and May 2023, when a spectacular eruptive intensification produced the largest ash columns of the current cycle (10+ km altitude), forced temporary closures of both Mexico City and Puebla airports, and prompted CENAPRED to raise the volcanic alert to Amarillo Fase 3 (the highest alert level before a full evacuation order). Ashfall reached Mexico City, 70 km away.\n\nAs of early 2026, Popocatépetl continues its pattern of dome growth, intermittent Vulcanian explosions, and minor ash emissions. The volcano's alert level fluctuates between Amarillo Fase 2 and Fase 3, and a 12 km (7.5 mi) exclusion zone remains in effect around the summit. CENAPRED estimates that the volcano produces an average of 10–20 daily volcanic tremor events and multiple daily minor explosions."

          "content": "Popocatépetl was in a state of heightened activity during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, providing one of the earliest European eyewitness accounts of New World volcanism. In September–October 1519, as Hernán Cortés marched his army from Veracruz toward Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City), the volcano was actively erupting with a VEI 3 eruption. Bernal Díaz del Castillo, a soldier in Cortés's expedition, described the volcano vividly in his account Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de la Nueva España, noting dense columns of smoke and ash rising from the summit. Cortés dispatched a small expedition led by Diego de Ordaz to climb the volcano — an extraordinary feat at 5,393 m altitude — though the climbers were reportedly turned back by dense ash and volcanic gases before reaching the summit crater. Ordaz was later granted a volcano on his coat of arms by King Charles V in recognition of the attempt. The eruption continued until approximately 1523."

Thick pumice-fall deposits from this eruption have been identified across the modern states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, and Morelos. Some researchers have suggested that this eruption contributed to the decline of the great city of Cholula, which lies approximately 40 km (25 mi) west of the volcano and was one of the most important urban and religious centers in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Archaeological evidence shows a significant population decline at Cholula around this period, though the extent to which the eruption was a causal factor versus concurrent social and political changes remains debated."

The eruption around 3700 BCE produced widespread pumice deposits and pyroclastic flows that traveled more than 20 km (12 mi) from the summit. The ~200 BCE event, similarly rated VEI 5, generated thick tephra fall deposits identified across central Mexico. These eruptions demonstrate that Popocatépetl is capable of explosive events vastly more powerful than anything observed in the current eruptive phase — a sobering consideration given the 25 million people now living within the volcano's reach."

    "current_status_and_monitoring": {
      "content": "As of early 2026, Popocatépetl remains in an active eruptive state, continuing the cycle of lava dome growth and periodic Vulcanian explosions that has characterized the volcano since 1996. The volcanic alert level is maintained by CENAPRED (Mexico's National Center for Disaster Prevention) using the Semáforo de Alerta Volcánica (Volcanic Alert Traffic Light) system, which typically stands at Amarillo (Yellow) Fase 2 or 3, indicating that the volcano is active with ongoing emissions and the potential for increased explosivity.\n\nPopocatépetl is monitored by one of the most comprehensive volcano surveillance networks in the Americas. CENAPRED and the UNAM Institute of Geophysics operate a dense array of broadband seismometers, tiltmeters, GPS stations, webcams (visible and thermal), COSPEC and DOAS instruments for continuous SO2 flux measurement, and airborne LIDAR surveys. The monitoring network detects an average of 10–20 volcanic tremor events and multiple minor explosions daily. Real-time webcam footage is publicly available and widely followed by media and the public.\n\nA permanent 12 km (7.5 mi) exclusion zone surrounds the summit, and evacuation plans exist for communities within the first (15 km), second (25 km), and third (35 km) hazard zones. The most significant evacuation to date occurred in December 2000, when approximately 41,000 people were relocated. CENAPRED maintains ongoing public education campaigns and evacuation drills in at-risk communities, with a particular focus on the lahar-prone valleys of the Nexapa and Huiloac rivers draining the volcano's eastern and northern flanks."
    },
    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "Popocatépetl is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, primarily because of the extraordinary population density within its hazard zones. Approximately 1 million people live within 30 km (19 mi) of the summit, and 25 million within 100 km (62 mi), including portions of the Mexico City metropolitan area (population ~22 million) and the entire Puebla metropolitan area (population ~3.2 million). Only <a href=\"/volcano/merapi\">Mount Merapi</a> in Indonesia rivals Popocatépetl for population exposure among active volcanoes.\n\nThe primary hazard during the current eruptive phase is lahars — volcanic mudflows generated when pyroclastic material mixes with water from glacial melt, rainfall, or snowpack on the upper slopes. Although Popocatépetl's glaciers have retreated significantly (losing an estimated 45% of their area between 1958 and 2020), sufficient ice and seasonal snow remains to generate lahars during explosive events. The Nexapa and Huiloac drainage systems channel potential lahar flows directly toward populated areas to the east and southeast. Numerical modeling suggests that a moderate eruption-triggered lahar could reach the town of Santiago Xalitzintla (population ~2,700), 12 km from the summit, within 30–45 minutes.\n\nA Plinian eruption — an event that has occurred at least twice in the Holocene (VEI 5) — would represent a catastrophic scenario. Pyroclastic flows could travel 20+ km in multiple directions, tephra fall would blanket Mexico City with centimeters to decimeters of ash (disrupting infrastructure, water supply, and aviation), and lahars would surge down all major drainages. Such an event would be one of the most consequential natural disasters in modern history. The probability of a VEI 5 eruption in any given year is very low, but it is not zero, and the current eruptive unrest means the volcano cannot be considered dormant."
    },
    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "Popocatépetl forms a massive, generally symmetrical stratovolcanic cone that dominates the landscape of central Mexico. The volcano rises from a base elevation of approximately 2,500 m (8,200 ft) on the surrounding plateau to a summit of 5,393 m (17,694 ft), with the upper 2,000+ m of the cone visible from distances exceeding 100 km (62 mi) on clear days. The summit crater, measuring approximately 400 × 600 m (1,310 × 1,970 ft) with near-vertical walls, contains the actively growing lava dome and fumarolic emissions.\n\nThe volcano's northwestern flank features the sharp peak of Ventorrillo (5,100 m / 16,730 ft), a remnant of an older volcanic cone that was partially destroyed by sector collapse. To the north, the extinct stratovolcano Iztaccíhuatl (5,230 m / 17,159 ft) rises just 15 km away, connected to Popocatépetl by the high-altitude Paso de Cortés saddle at approximately 3,680 m (12,070 ft). The pairing of these two snow-capped peaks — Popocatépetl actively smoking, Iztaccíhuatl appearing to recline — is one of the most recognizable mountain landscapes in the Americas.\n\nAlthough Popocatépetl is glacier-clad, its glaciers have been in rapid retreat. The remaining ice covers less than 0.5 km2, down from approximately 0.9 km2 in 1958 and an estimated 1.6 km2 at the beginning of the 20th century. The retreat is driven by both climate warming and volcanic heating. Below the glacial zone, the upper slopes are barren volcanic scree; mid-elevation flanks support alpine grassland (zacatonal) and pine–fir forest; and lower slopes transition into agricultural land, including the communities and farmsteads that make up the volcano's extensive hazard zone."
    },
    "climate_and_global_impact": {
      "content": "Popocatépetl's current eruptive activity — characterized by dome-building and moderate Vulcanian explosions — has no significant impact on global climate. Ash columns rarely exceed 10 km altitude, well below the stratospheric injection threshold required for hemispheric climate effects. However, the volcano's intermittent ash emissions have measurable regional impacts: ashfall from major explosions has reached Mexico City (70 km away) on multiple occasions, disrupting aviation at Benito Juárez International Airport and the Puebla airport, and depositing ash on crops and infrastructure.\n\nA future Plinian eruption (VEI 4–5) would have substantially greater atmospheric impact. The ~200 BCE VEI 5 eruption injected large volumes of tephra and likely significant SO2 into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. An event of similar magnitude today would disrupt North American and potentially transatlantic aviation for days to weeks, deposit centimeters of ash across Mexico City (affecting critical infrastructure for 22 million residents), and could inject sufficient sulfur aerosols to produce a measurable but short-lived cooling effect. The primary \"climate\" impact, however, would be the humanitarian and economic catastrophe of ashfall and lahars affecting one of the world's largest urban corridors."

    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "Popocatépetl occupies a central place in Mexican national identity and mythology. In the most widely known Aztec legend, Popocatépetl was a warrior who fell in love with Iztaccíhuatl, the daughter of a chief. Falsely told that Popocatépetl had died in battle, Iztaccíhuatl died of grief. Upon his return, the heartbroken warrior carried her body to the mountains, where the gods transformed the lovers into twin volcanoes — Iztaccíhuatl lying in eternal sleep (the peak's profile resembles a reclining female figure), and Popocatépetl standing vigil beside her, his smoldering summit a sign of his undying grief. This legend is one of Mexico's most beloved folk narratives and is widely reproduced in art, literature, and tourism.\n\nThe volcano's Nahuatl name, Popocatépetl (\"Smoking Mountain\"), reflects its persistent fumarolic and eruptive activity, which has been observed continuously since Pre-Columbian times. Aztec codices document eruptions from the 14th century onward, and the volcano featured prominently in Aztec cosmology as a sacred mountain. The 14 early 16th-century monasteries built on the lower slopes of Popocatépetl by Augustinian, Dominican, and Franciscan missionaries — constructed partly to Christianize the indigenous communities living in the volcano's shadow — are inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIn modern Mexico, Popocatépetl is universally known by its affectionate nickname \"Don Goyo\" (after a folk legend of a peasant farmer who embodies the volcano's spirit) and its eruptions are major national news events. The volcano's smoking profile appears on countless murals, photographs, and postcards, and its visibility from Mexico City makes it a daily presence in the lives of tens of millions of people."
    },
    "visiting_and_tourism": {
      "content": "Due to ongoing eruptive activity, access to Popocatépetl's summit and upper slopes is prohibited. A permanent 12 km (7.5 mi) exclusion zone enforced by CENAPRED and Mexican civil protection authorities has been in effect since the late 1990s, and climbing the volcano is not permitted. Prior to the current eruptive phase, the summit was a popular mountaineering objective — one of the few walk-up 5,000 m+ peaks in the world.\n\nHowever, the surrounding Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park offers extensive hiking, mountaineering, and sightseeing opportunities with dramatic views of Popocatépetl's smoking cone. The Paso de Cortés (3,680 m / 12,070 ft), the saddle between Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl, is accessible by paved road from Amecameca and provides one of the closest legal viewpoints of the active volcano. Iztaccíhuatl (5,230 m), the neighboring extinct volcano, is one of Mexico's premier mountaineering objectives and is legally climbable year-round.\n\nThe town of Amecameca, at the volcano's western base, serves as the gateway to the park and offers food, lodging, and guides. The UNESCO-listed 16th-century monasteries on Popocatépetl's slopes — including those at Huejotzingo, Calpan, and Tochimilco — are outstanding cultural attractions accessible from Puebla or Mexico City. The volcano is approximately 90 minutes by car from central Mexico City via the Puebla highway."

Its nearest volcanic neighbor is the extinct stratovolcano Iztaccíhuatl (5,230 m / 17,159 ft), just 15 km (9 mi) to the north, which last erupted approximately 11,000 years ago and is now a major mountaineering destination. Together, the Izta-Popo pair forms the dramatic eastern wall of the Valley of Mexico.\n\nTo the west-northwest, <a href=\"/volcano/colima\">Volcán de Colima</a> (3,850 m / 12,631 ft) is Mexico's most active volcano after Popocatépetl, with 85 recorded eruptions and frequent explosive activity. Pico de Orizaba (Citlaltépetl, 5,636 m / 18,491 ft), Mexico's highest peak and a dormant stratovolcano, rises 150 km to the east. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt also includes the famous cinder cone Parícutin, which emerged in a farmer's cornfield in 1943 — one of only two volcanoes observed from birth. To the south in Guatemala, <a href=\"/volcano/fuego\">Volcán de Fuego</a> (3,799 m) is another highly active and dangerous stratovolcano that has produced deadly pyroclastic flows, most recently in 2018."

    "etymology": {
      "content": "The name Popocatépetl derives from the Nahuatl language (the language of the Aztecs and still spoken by approximately 1.7 million people in central Mexico). It is a compound of popōca (\"it smokes\" or \"smoking\") and tepētl (\"mountain\"), translating literally as \"Smoking Mountain.\" The name is a straightforward description of the volcano's persistent fumarolic and eruptive activity, which has been observed continuously for centuries. In colloquial Mexican Spanish, the volcano is affectionately called \"Don Goyo\" — after a folk legend of an elderly peasant farmer named Gregorio who is said to embody the spirit of the volcano and who reportedly appears to warn local villagers before major eruptions."

    "Approximately 25 million people live within 100 km of Popocatépetl's summit, making it arguably the most population-exposed active volcano on Earth.",
    "The volcano's name in Nahuatl, Popocatépetl ('Smoking Mountain'), has been descriptively accurate for at least 700 years — the summit has been continuously fuming since Pre-Columbian times.",
    "Popocatépetl has produced at least two VEI 5 Plinian eruptions in the Holocene (~3700 BCE and ~200 BCE), demonstrating it is capable of events comparable to the 79 CE destruction of Pompeii by Vesuvius.",
    "The volcano was actively erupting during the Spanish Conquest of Mexico in 1519–1521 — Hernán Cortés dispatched an expedition led by Diego de Ordaz to attempt to climb it.",
    "At 5,393 m (17,694 ft), Popocatépetl is North America's second-highest volcano and the second-tallest peak in Mexico, after Pico de Orizaba.",
    "The current eruptive phase began in December 1994 after 67 years of dormancy, and the volcano has been in a state of continuous dome-building and intermittent explosive activity ever since.",
    "In December 2000, approximately 41,000 people were evacuated from communities near the volcano when explosive activity intensified and the first pyroclastic flows of the current phase were observed.",
    "Popocatépetl's glaciers have lost approximately 45% of their area between 1958 and 2020, driven by both climate warming and volcanic heating — but sufficient ice remains to generate dangerous lahars.",
    "Fourteen early 16th-century monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl are inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, built by Franciscan, Dominican, and Augustinian missionaries shortly after the Conquest.",
    "The volcano is affectionately known in Mexico as 'Don Goyo,' after a folk legend of an elderly peasant farmer named Gregorio who embodies the volcano's spirit and appears before major eruptions.",
    "In May 2023, a major eruptive intensification produced ash columns exceeding 10 km altitude, forced closure of airports in Mexico City and Puebla, and deposited ash on both cities.",
    "Popocatépetl and neighboring Iztaccíhuatl are immortalized in Aztec legend as star-crossed lovers — a warrior (the smoking volcano) standing eternal vigil over his sleeping princess (the reclining peak)."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Popocatépetl erupting right now?",
      "answer": "Yes, Popocatépetl has been in a state of continuous eruptive activity since its reawakening in December 1994. The current eruptive phase, officially catalogued as beginning in January 2005, involves ongoing lava dome growth within the summit crater, periodic Vulcanian explosions that destroy the dome and send ash columns 5–10 km above the crater, and continuous gas and steam emissions. As of early 2026, CENAPRED (Mexico's disaster prevention agency) maintains the volcanic alert at Yellow Phase 2 or 3, indicating ongoing activity with potential for escalation. A 12 km exclusion zone surrounds the summit, and the volcano produces multiple minor explosions daily."
    },
    {
      "question": "How dangerous is Popocatépetl?",
      "answer": "Popocatépetl is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, primarily due to its extraordinary population exposure. Approximately 25 million people live within 100 km of the summit, including parts of the Mexico City metropolitan area (population ~22 million) and the entire Puebla metro area (~3.2 million). The volcano has produced VEI 5 Plinian eruptions in its geological past, and its current activity demonstrates it remains fully capable of explosive eruptions. The primary threats are lahars (volcanic mudflows descending glacier-fed valleys into populated areas), pyroclastic flows, and widespread ashfall. CENAPRED maintains active evacuation plans for communities within 15, 25, and 35 km hazard zones."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall is Popocatépetl?",
      "answer": "Popocatépetl stands at 5,393 m (17,694 ft) above sea level, making it the second-highest peak in Mexico after Pico de Orizaba (5,636 m / 18,491 ft) and the second-highest volcano in North America. Its summit rises approximately 2,900 m (9,500 ft) above the surrounding plateau, creating an imposing visual presence visible from both Mexico City (70 km northwest) and Puebla (43 km east) on clear days. The summit hosts a steep-walled crater measuring approximately 400 × 600 m that contains an actively growing lava dome."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Popocatépetl mean?",
      "answer": "Popocatépetl is a Nahuatl word meaning 'Smoking Mountain.' It is composed of two Nahuatl roots: popōca ('it smokes' or 'smoking') and tepētl ('mountain'). The name accurately describes the volcano's persistent fumarolic and eruptive activity, which has been continuously observed since Pre-Columbian times and was recorded in Aztec codices from the 14th century onward. Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec Empire, is still spoken by approximately 1.7 million people in central Mexico. The volcano is also widely known by its affectionate Mexican nickname 'Don Goyo.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "Could Popocatépetl destroy Mexico City?",
      "answer": "A large eruption of Popocatépetl would not 'destroy' Mexico City in the sense of a pyroclastic flow reaching the capital — the city lies 70 km from the summit, beyond the typical reach of even major pyroclastic flows. However, a VEI 4–5 Plinian eruption could devastate Mexico City through ashfall. Centimeters to decimeters of volcanic ash deposited on the metropolitan area would collapse roofs, contaminate water supplies, shut down transportation and aviation, damage electronics and machinery, and cause severe respiratory health effects for 22 million residents. Lahars would devastate communities closer to the volcano. Such an event would be one of the most consequential natural disasters in modern history."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did Popocatépetl last have a major eruption?",
      "answer": "The most recent major Plinian eruption of Popocatépetl occurred around 800 CE (VEI 4), producing extensive pyroclastic flows and lahars that swept surrounding basins. The most powerful known eruptions occurred around 3700 BCE and 200 BCE, both rated VEI 5. In the modern era, the most significant eruptive episodes were: December 2000, when explosive activity generated the first pyroclastic flows of the current cycle and forced evacuation of 41,000 people; and May 2023, when ash columns exceeded 10 km altitude and ashfall reached Mexico City. The current eruptive phase (since 1994) has not yet produced a Plinian eruption but demonstrates the volcano is fully active."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you climb Popocatépetl?",
      "answer": "No, climbing Popocatépetl is prohibited due to ongoing volcanic activity. A permanent 12 km exclusion zone enforced by CENAPRED surrounds the summit, and access to the upper slopes is restricted. Prior to the volcano's reawakening in 1994, the summit was a popular mountaineering objective — one of the few walk-up peaks above 5,000 m in the world. The neighboring extinct volcano Iztaccíhuatl (5,230 m), connected to Popocatépetl by the Paso de Cortés, remains open for mountaineering and offers dramatic views of Popocatépetl's smoking summit. The national park surrounding both volcanoes is accessible for hiking at lower elevations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many people live near Popocatépetl?",
      "answer": "Approximately 1 million people live within 30 km of Popocatépetl's summit, including dozens of small towns and villages on the volcano's lower flanks. Within a 100 km radius, approximately 25 million people are exposed to potential volcanic hazards — this figure includes portions of the Mexico City metropolitan area (population ~22 million) to the northwest and the entire Puebla metropolitan area (~3.2 million) to the east. The nearest significant town, Santiago Xalitzintla (population ~2,700), lies just 12 km from the summit crater. This extraordinary population exposure is what makes Popocatépetl one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the legend of Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl?",
      "answer": "In the most famous version of the Aztec legend, Popocatépetl was a great warrior who fell in love with Iztaccíhuatl, the beautiful daughter of a tribal chief. The chief agreed to their marriage on the condition that Popocatépetl first prove himself in battle. While he was away fighting, a rival falsely reported that Popocatépetl had been killed. Iztaccíhuatl, overwhelmed with grief, died of a broken heart. When Popocatépetl returned victorious, he carried her body to the mountains, where the gods transformed the lovers into twin volcanoes — Iztaccíhuatl lying in eternal sleep (her reclining profile is visible in the mountain's ridgeline), and Popocatépetl standing vigil beside her, his smoking summit a sign of his undying grief."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Popocatépetl called Don Goyo?",
      "answer": "Popocatépetl is affectionately called 'Don Goyo' in Mexican popular culture, after a widespread folk legend in communities near the volcano. According to local tradition, the spirit of the volcano manifests as an elderly peasant farmer named Gregorio ('Goyo' is the common nickname for Gregorio). Don Goyo is said to appear to villagers in the days before major eruptions to warn them to evacuate. Many residents of communities like Santiago Xalitzintla maintain a tradition of offering food, drink, and flowers to Don Goyo on his 'birthday' (March 12) as a way of paying respect to the volcano and requesting protection. The tradition blends Pre-Columbian and Catholic beliefs."
