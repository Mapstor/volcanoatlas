      "content": "Arenal (Spanish: Volcán Arenal) is an active stratovolcano rising to 1,670 m (5,479 ft) on the eastern shore of Lake Arenal in Alajuela Province, northwestern <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-costa-rica\">Costa Rica</a>. It is the youngest stratovolcano in the country, with its earliest known eruptions dating to approximately 7,000 years ago, and one of the most active volcanoes in Central America, having erupted continuously from 1968 to 2010 — a 42-year eruptive period characterized by Strombolian explosions, lava flows, and occasional pyroclastic flows from vents at the summit and upper western flank.\n\nArenal's nearly perfect conical form, rising dramatically above the surrounding lowland rainforest and cattle pastures, has made it one of the most recognizable and most visited volcanoes in the Americas. During its active decades, nighttime Strombolian eruptions — incandescent lava fountains and glowing rockfalls visible from the town of La Fortuna, 6 km to the east — drew hundreds of thousands of tourists annually and transformed the surrounding region into Costa Rica's premier adventure tourism destination. The 1968 eruption that initiated the modern eruptive period was far more violent: a VEI 3 explosive event that killed 87 people and obliterated the villages of Tabacón, Pueblo Nuevo, and San Luis.\n\nArenal lies along a volcanic chain that has migrated northwestward over time from the late-Pleistocene Los Perdidos lava domes through the Pleistocene-to-Holocene Cerro Chato volcano (which contains a lake-filled summit crater and last erupted approximately 3,500 years ago) to the modern Arenal cone. The volcano sits within the <a href=\"/ring-of-fire\">Central American volcanic arc</a>, generated by the subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate. Since December 2010, Arenal has been in a quiet phase with only fumarolic emissions from the summit craters, but volcanologists consider a return to eruptive activity highly probable given the volcano's 7,000-year history of alternating explosive and effusive eruption cycles at intervals of several hundred years."

    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Arenal is situated within the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA), a chain of over 50 active volcanoes extending from Guatemala to Panama, generated by the subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate at the Middle America Trench. The convergence rate in the Costa Rican segment is approximately 8–9 cm per year — among the fastest subduction rates on Earth — and the subducting slab reaches depths sufficient for magma generation approximately 100 km beneath Arenal.\n\nThe volcano sits on continental crust exceeding 25 km in thickness, and its andesitic to basaltic-andesitic magma composition reflects a typical subduction zone petrogenesis: partial melting of the mantle wedge above the downgoing slab, with subsequent fractional crystallization and crustal assimilation. The resulting lavas are intermediate in silica content (typically 54–60% SiO₂), producing eruptions that range from moderately explosive (Strombolian to sub-Plinian) to effusive (slow lava flows). This compositional range is directly responsible for Arenal's characteristic eruption style during 1968–2010: alternating explosive and effusive phases from the same vent system.\n\nArenal is geologically young. The earliest known eruptions occurred approximately 7,000 years ago, making it significantly younger than most Cascade or Andean stratovolcanoes. The volcano grew contemporaneously with neighboring Cerro Chato (now extinct, with a 500-m-wide lake-filled summit crater) until Chato's activity ceased approximately 3,500 years ago. Arenal's growth has been characterized by a cyclical pattern: periodic major explosive eruptions at intervals of several hundred years that deposit widespread tephra layers, separated by longer periods of lava effusion that progressively armor and build the cone.\n\nStratigraphic studies have identified at least ten major tephra layers in the surrounding soils, corresponding to VEI 4 explosive eruptions occurring roughly every 300–500 years. The most recent such event before 1968 occurred approximately 600 years ago (circa 1400 CE). The 1968 eruption, at VEI 3, was somewhat smaller than these prehistoric cycles, raising the possibility that the current quiet phase may be interrupted by a larger event in the future. The 1968–2010 effusive period is interpreted as a cone-armoring phase similar to those that followed prehistoric explosive events."
    },
    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "The Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program records 28 eruptions for Arenal, spanning from approximately 5060 BCE to 2010 CE. The record is dominated by VEI 4 explosive eruptions in the prehistoric period (at least ten events between ~5060 BCE and ~1400 CE), followed by smaller historic eruptions in the 20th century. The eruption pattern reveals a remarkably consistent cycle: major explosive events at intervals of roughly 300–500 years, separated by quieter periods of cone-building effusion.\n\nBefore 1968, Arenal was considered dormant and was not recognized as a significant volcanic threat. Local inhabitants knew the mountain as 'Cerro Arenal' (Arenal Hill) or 'Pan de Azúcar' (Sugarloaf), and its flanks were farmed and settled. The July 1968 eruption shattered this perception and initiated the longest continuous eruption in Costa Rica's recorded history, lasting 42 years until December 2010. The eruption is documented in extraordinary detail because it occurred during the modern era of volcanological monitoring and attracted decades of sustained scientific attention.\n\nNotable eruption periods from the Smithsonian data include a cluster of VEI 4 events between approximately 400 and 1030 CE (five eruptions in ~600 years), and the two most recent prehistoric VEI 4 eruptions in approximately 1400 and 1440 CE. An uncertain eruption is reported in 1915, and a confirmed VEI 2 eruption occurred in 1922 — events that were poorly documented due to the area's remoteness. The <a href=\"/volcanic-explosivity-index\">VEI</a> 3 eruption that began in 1968 was far more comprehensively recorded and studied."

          "title": "The 1968 Eruption — Arenal Reawakens Catastrophically",
          "content": "On July 29, 1968, Arenal exploded without significant precursory warning after approximately 500 years of apparent quiescence. At approximately 7:30 AM local time, a series of violent lateral blasts erupted from three new craters (designated A, B, and C) on the volcano's western flank at elevations between 1,060 and 1,300 m. The initial blasts directed devastating pyroclastic surges and ballistic projectiles westward and northwestward, obliterating the villages of Tabacón, Pueblo Nuevo, and San Luis within minutes.\n\nThe eruption killed 87 people — 78 from pyroclastic surges and ballistic impacts in the initial blasts, and 9 from subsequent events. Over 200 head of cattle were killed, and approximately 232 houses were destroyed. The explosive opening phase was followed by a sustained Plinian column reaching an estimated 10 km altitude, depositing tephra across the surrounding countryside. Lava bombs weighing up to several tons were ejected up to 5 km from the craters.\n\nThe initial explosivity was particularly dangerous because the directed blasts (analogous in mechanism, though not in scale, to the 1980 <a href=\"/volcano/st-helens\">Mount St. Helens</a> lateral blast) traveled at estimated speeds exceeding 300 km/h. Victims in Tabacón had virtually no warning. The death toll would have been far higher had the blasts been directed toward La Fortuna to the east, which lay within potential range.\n\nThe July 1968 event transitioned within weeks into a sustained eruption from Crater C (the lowest and westernmost of the three new vents) that would continue for 42 years. This long-duration phase was characterized by continuous Strombolian activity — small explosions every few minutes to hours ejecting incandescent lava fragments — accompanied by the slow extrusion of andesitic lava flows from the summit and Crater C. The lava flows descended primarily down the western and southwestern flanks, rarely exceeding 3 km in length."

          "title": "The 1968–2010 Continuous Eruption — Four Decades of Strombolian Activity",
          "content": "Following the catastrophic opening of 1968, Arenal settled into a pattern of persistent low-level eruption that lasted until December 2010 — one of the longest continuous eruptions in the Western Hemisphere during the 20th century. Activity was concentrated at Crater C on the upper western flank, with intermittent eruptions also occurring from the summit Crater D.\n\nThe eruption style was predominantly Strombolian: rhythmic, small-scale explosions ejecting incandescent lava bombs and blocks to heights of 100–500 m above the crater rim, occurring at intervals ranging from minutes to hours. These explosions were often spectacularly visible at night from La Fortuna and surrounding viewpoints, creating the vivid nighttime light shows that became Arenal's signature tourism draw.\n\nLava effusion was nearly continuous, producing aa-type andesitic flows that crept down the volcano's western and southwestern flanks. Individual flows were typically 0.5–2 km long and tens of meters wide. The cumulative lava output over 42 years was estimated at approximately 0.6 km³ — modest by global standards but sufficient to substantially rebuild the volcano's western flank. The lava field on the western side, still largely unvegetated, is a prominent feature visible from throughout the region.\n\nPyroclastic flows occurred periodically — typically small-volume, gravity-driven collapses of lava flow fronts or explosion-generated density currents that traveled 1–3 km down the flanks. The most significant pyroclastic flow event occurred on August 23, 2000, when a collapsed lava dome generated flows that reached the base of the volcano. On September 5, 2003, a pyroclastic flow traveled 2 km, reaching areas occasionally used by tourists and prompting the expansion of restricted zones.\n\nThe eruption rate declined gradually through the 2000s, and by mid-2010, activity had diminished to weak fumarolic emissions with no explosions or lava extrusion. By October 2010, seismic activity had dropped to background levels, and the eruption was officially declared over in December 2010."

          "title": "Prehistoric Major Eruptions — The VEI 4 Cycle",
          "content": "Stratigraphic analysis of tephra layers in soils surrounding Arenal reveals a pattern of major explosive eruptions (VEI 4) occurring at remarkably regular intervals. At least ten such eruptions have been identified between approximately 5060 BCE and 1400 CE, occurring roughly every 300–500 years. Each of these events deposited widespread pumice and ash layers, some extending tens of kilometers from the summit.\n\nThe most significant of these include the eruptions of approximately 5060 BCE, 3900 BCE, 3350 BCE, 2800 BCE, and 1450 BCE — each rated VEI 4, indicating eruptions roughly ten times more explosive than the 1968 opening phase. These events likely produced sustained Plinian or sub-Plinian columns, widespread tephra fall, and pyroclastic flows significantly larger than anything observed during the 1968–2010 period. The regularity of the cycle raises the possibility that a VEI 4 event could occur in the future, potentially with much greater impact than the 1968 eruption given the dramatic growth of settlement and tourism infrastructure near the volcano since the mid-20th century."

    "current_status_and_monitoring": {
      "content": "Since December 2010, Arenal has been in a quiet phase characterized by weak fumarolic emissions from the summit craters (primarily Crater D) and normal background seismicity. No lava extrusion, Strombolian explosions, or significant degassing has been observed. The volcano is monitored continuously by <a href=\"https://www.ovsicori.una.ac.cr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OVSICORI-UNA</a> (the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica at the National University) and the RSN (National Seismological Network, operated jointly by the University of Costa Rica and ICE).\n\nThe monitoring network includes seismometers deployed around the volcano's base to detect earthquakes associated with magma movement, tiltmeters and GPS stations to measure ground deformation, and SO₂ and CO₂ gas monitoring equipment. Satellite-based thermal monitoring (using MODIS and Sentinel-2 data) tracks any changes in surface heat output from the summit area.\n\nVolcanologists do not consider the current quiet phase to be the end of Arenal's eruptive life. The volcano's 7,000-year history demonstrates alternating cycles of explosive eruptions and effusive periods, with quiet intervals typically lasting decades to centuries. The 42-year eruption of 1968–2010 is interpreted as the most recent effusive/Strombolian cone-building phase, and the current repose may last years or decades before the next eruption. The Comisión Nacional de Emergencias (CNE) maintains an active hazard management plan for the Arenal area, and restricted zones on the volcano's upper flanks remain in effect."
    },
    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "Arenal presents a range of volcanic hazards to the surrounding population and tourism infrastructure. The town of La Fortuna (population approximately 20,000) lies just 6 km east of the summit, and the broader San Carlos canton has a population exceeding 80,000. Arenal Volcano National Park and the surrounding hot springs resorts, zip-line parks, and adventure tourism operations attract over one million visitors annually, many of whom are within potential hazard zones.\n\nThe primary hazards include pyroclastic flows and surges, ballistic projectiles, tephra fall, lahars, and lava flows. The 1968 eruption demonstrated that directed blasts can devastate areas up to 5 km from the crater with virtually no warning. Pyroclastic flows during the 1968–2010 eruption reached 1–3 km from the summit, but a VEI 4 event (consistent with the prehistoric record) could generate flows reaching 5–10 km — potentially threatening La Fortuna itself.\n\nLahars (volcanic mudflows) are a significant concern because Arenal's flanks receive approximately 3,500–5,000 mm of rainfall annually. Eruption-generated debris mixing with heavy tropical rainfall can produce lahars that travel rapidly down river valleys. The Río Tabacón, Río Agua Caliente, and other drainages descending from Arenal pass through populated and tourism-developed areas.\n\nThe OVSICORI-UNA and CNE maintain a volcanic alert level system with color-coded stages (green, yellow, orange, red). As of 2025, Arenal is at Green (normal background activity). Hazard zone maps define restricted areas on the volcano's upper flanks where access is prohibited. However, enforcement is challenging given the area's popularity with tourists, and informal trails continue to provide access to areas within potential pyroclastic flow range."

    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "Arenal is a classic, near-symmetrical conical stratovolcano rising 1,670 m (5,479 ft) above sea level — approximately 1,200 m above the surrounding lowland landscape. The cone is relatively small by global standards, with a basal diameter of roughly 6–7 km, but its steep flanks (averaging 35–40° near the summit) and isolation above flat terrain give it a dramatic, imposing profile that dominates the landscape for tens of kilometers in every direction.\n\nThe summit area hosts multiple craters. Crater D, at the true summit, is the primary fumarolic vent. Craters A, B, and C opened on the western flank during the 1968 eruption, with Crater C (at approximately 1,300 m elevation) serving as the primary vent for the 1968–2010 eruption. The western and southwestern flanks are draped with dark, unvegetated lava flows from the recent eruption, creating a stark visual contrast with the lush tropical vegetation covering the eastern and northern slopes.\n\nLake Arenal, Costa Rica's largest lake (85.5 km² surface area), lies immediately west of the volcano. The lake was enlarged in 1979 by the construction of the Arenal Dam for hydroelectric power generation, and the Arenal reservoir now supplies approximately 12% of Costa Rica's electricity. The juxtaposition of the volcanic cone, the lake, and the surrounding tropical forest creates a landscape of exceptional scenic value.\n\nCerro Chato, Arenal's extinct predecessor, rises to 1,140 m approximately 3 km to the southeast. Its summit contains a 500-m-wide, lake-filled crater accessible via a popular hiking trail. The contrast between Chato's heavily eroded, densely forested profile and Arenal's sharp, largely bare cone illustrates the difference between an extinct and an active volcanic edifice."
    },
    "climate_and_global_impact": {
      "content": "Arenal's eruptions during the 1968–2010 period were too small to produce measurable global climatic effects. The VEI 3 eruptions and continuous Strombolian activity injected modest amounts of sulfur dioxide and ash into the lower atmosphere but lacked the explosive power to breach the tropical tropopause (approximately 15–17 km altitude) and deliver aerosols to the stratosphere where they could influence global climate.\n\nHowever, the volcano's prehistoric VEI 4 eruptions would have had regional atmospheric effects. Sub-Plinian to Plinian columns from VEI 4 events in tropical latitudes can inject material into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, potentially causing regional cooling and affecting precipitation patterns across Central America and the Caribbean. The cumulative effect of Arenal's multiple VEI 4 eruptions over 7,000 years may have contributed to episodic disruption of agriculture and settlement in the region, though direct archaeological evidence linking eruptions to societal impacts is limited.\n\nLocally, Arenal's 42-year eruption contributed to measurable acid rain (sulfuric and hydrochloric acid) in the immediate downwind area, primarily affecting vegetation on the volcano's western flank and, to a lesser extent, forests to the west. Volcanic aerosols (primarily vog — volcanic fog composed of SO₂ and sulfate particles) occasionally affected air quality in La Fortuna when wind patterns shifted."

    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "Arenal has transformed from an obscure rural hill into one of the most culturally and economically significant volcanoes in the Americas. Before 1968, the area around 'Cerro Arenal' was a remote agricultural region of cattle ranches and small farms. The volcanic eruption and subsequent decades of continuous activity catalyzed a complete economic and cultural transformation.\n\nBy the 1990s, Arenal had become Costa Rica's top tourism destination, anchoring a regional economy built on volcano viewing, hot springs, adventure sports (zip-lining, white-water rafting, hanging bridges), and ecotourism in the surrounding cloud forest and lowland rainforest. The Tabacón Hot Springs, heated by volcanic activity on the northern flank, became one of the country's most famous resort destinations. The nearby town of La Fortuna grew from a small agricultural village into a bustling tourist hub.\n\nThe eruption's impact on Costa Rica's national identity and international reputation as an ecotourism destination is difficult to overstate. Arenal became the visual symbol of Costa Rica's volcanic landscape — appearing on postcards, tourism brochures, and promotional materials worldwide. The nightly Strombolian displays were a defining experience for visitors to the country between the 1990s and 2010.\n\nThe 2010 cessation of visible eruptions created economic anxiety in the La Fortuna area, but the regional tourism industry successfully pivoted from active-eruption viewing to broader nature and adventure tourism, leveraging the volcanic landscape, hot springs, and biodiversity that the eruption had helped publicize. Arenal Volcano National Park (established 1991) and the adjacent Arenal Hanging Bridges preserve attract visitors year-round."

      "content": "Arenal is Costa Rica's most visited volcano, located approximately 130 km (3-hour drive) northwest of San José via La Fortuna de San Carlos. The area offers an extraordinary density of tourism infrastructure and activities built around the volcanic landscape.\n\nArenal Volcano National Park (entrance fee approximately $15 USD for foreigners) provides maintained trails through lava fields from the 1968 and 1992 eruptions, offering close-up views of the cone from its eastern and southern flanks. The park's trails are moderate in difficulty and suitable for most fitness levels. The volcano's summit and upper flanks are restricted — climbing to the crater is prohibited due to ongoing hazard concerns.\n\nThe region's hot springs are among its greatest draws. Multiple hot spring resorts line the northern flank, including Tabacón, Baldi, Ecotermales, and others, ranging from luxurious resort settings to budget-friendly options. The springs are heated by residual volcanic activity and maintain temperatures between 25°C and 65°C (77–149°F) in various pools.\n\nAdventure activities available in the Arenal area include zip-lining (canopy tours), hanging bridges through cloud forest canopy, white-water rafting on the Pacuare and Balsa rivers, waterfall rappelling (canyoneering) at La Fortuna Waterfall, mountain biking, horseback riding, and kayaking on Lake Arenal. The Cerro Chato hike (moderate to strenuous, approximately 4 hours round trip) leads to the crater lake of Arenal's extinct neighbor.\n\nBest visiting conditions are from December to April (dry season), though Arenal's microclimate means clouds and rain are possible year-round. Mornings typically offer the clearest views of the summit."

Before the 1968 eruption revealed its volcanic nature to the broader public, locals also referred to the mountain as 'Pan de Azúcar' (Sugarloaf) for its conical shape, and 'Cerro Arenal' (Arenal Hill). Lake Arenal, adjacent to the volcano, shares the same etymological origin."

    "Arenal erupted continuously for 42 years (1968–2010), making it one of the longest-duration eruptions in the Western Hemisphere during that period.",
    "The 1968 eruption killed 87 people and destroyed three villages — Tabacón, Pueblo Nuevo, and San Luis — within minutes of the initial blasts.",
    "Before the 1968 eruption, Arenal was not recognized as a significant volcanic threat and was referred to locally as 'Cerro Arenal' (Arenal Hill) or 'Pan de Azúcar' (Sugarloaf).",
    "Arenal is the youngest stratovolcano in Costa Rica, with its first known eruptions dating to only approximately 7,000 years ago.",
    "The volcano has produced at least ten VEI 4 explosive eruptions over 7,000 years, occurring at remarkably regular intervals of roughly 300–500 years.",
    "Lake Arenal, immediately west of the volcano, is Costa Rica's largest lake and generates approximately 12% of the country's electricity through the Arenal hydroelectric dam.",
    "During the 1968–2010 eruption, Arenal's nighttime Strombolian displays — incandescent lava fountains visible from La Fortuna — transformed the region into Costa Rica's top tourism destination.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Arenal Volcano still active?",
      "answer": "Yes, Arenal is classified as active by the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program and Costa Rica's OVSICORI-UNA monitoring agency. The volcano erupted continuously from July 1968 to December 2010 — a 42-year eruptive period. Since 2010, Arenal has been in a quiet phase with only weak fumarolic (steam and gas) emissions from the summit craters. Volcanologists do not consider this the end of Arenal's activity; the volcano's 7,000-year history shows alternating cycles of explosive eruptions and quiet periods lasting decades to centuries. A return to eruptive activity is considered probable, though the timing is uncertain. The volcano is continuously monitored by seismometers, gas detectors, and satellite instruments."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did Arenal last erupt?",
      "answer": "Arenal's most recent eruption ended in December 2010, concluding a 42-year continuous eruption that began on July 29, 1968. The eruption was characterized by Strombolian explosions (incandescent lava fountains), slow-moving lava flows, and occasional pyroclastic flows from vents at the summit and upper western flank. Activity gradually declined through the 2000s, with the last significant lava extrusion occurring in late 2010. Since then, the volcano has exhibited only weak fumarolic emissions and normal background seismicity. Before the 1968 eruption, the previous confirmed eruption occurred in 1922 (VEI 2), though the volcano was not widely recognized as active at that time."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many people died in the 1968 Arenal eruption?",
      "answer": "The 1968 eruption of Arenal killed 87 people. The deaths occurred primarily during the initial explosive phase on July 29, 1968, when lateral blasts from three newly opened craters on the western flank generated pyroclastic surges and launched ballistic projectiles at high velocity. The villages of Tabacón, Pueblo Nuevo, and San Luis were destroyed within minutes. Seventy-eight of the 87 deaths were caused by pyroclastic surges and ballistic impacts in the initial blasts; the remaining nine occurred in subsequent events over the following days. Approximately 232 houses were destroyed and over 200 cattle were killed. The death toll would have been far higher had the blasts been directed toward La Fortuna, the nearest town."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you visit Arenal Volcano?",
      "answer": "Yes, Arenal is Costa Rica's most visited volcano. Arenal Volcano National Park (entrance ~$15 USD) offers maintained trails through lava fields from the 1968 and 1992 eruptions with close-up views of the cone. The town of La Fortuna, 6 km east of the summit, serves as the base for visiting and offers abundant accommodation, restaurants, and tour operators. The summit and upper flanks are restricted — climbing to the crater is prohibited due to ongoing hazard risk. Popular activities include hot springs (Tabacón, Baldi, Ecotermales), hanging bridges, zip-lining, La Fortuna Waterfall, and the Cerro Chato crater lake hike. The area is approximately 130 km (3 hours) northwest of San José. December through April offers the best weather."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of volcano is Arenal?",
      "answer": "Arenal is a stratovolcano (also called a composite volcano) — a steep-sided, conical volcano built from alternating layers of lava flows, tephra (volcanic ash and rock fragments), and pyroclastic deposits. Its nearly perfect conical shape is a textbook example of a young, well-built stratovolcano. Arenal's magma is andesitic to basaltic-andesitic in composition, typical of subduction zone volcanoes. This magma composition produces eruptions that range from moderately explosive (Strombolian to sub-Plinian) to effusive (lava flows), explaining the volcano's characteristic alternation between explosive openings and long periods of lava effusion, as demonstrated during the 1968–2010 eruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall is Arenal Volcano?",
      "answer": "Arenal stands 1,670 m (5,479 ft) above sea level, rising approximately 1,200 m above the surrounding lowland landscape. While modest compared to some Central American volcanoes — Irazú (3,432 m) is Costa Rica's tallest — Arenal's steep flanks and isolation above flat terrain give it a dramatic, imposing appearance. The volcano's height has fluctuated with eruptions: material was added to the summit area during the 1968–2010 eruption, while explosive events periodically remove summit material. The pre-1968 summit stood somewhat lower. Neighboring Cerro Chato, Arenal's extinct predecessor, reaches 1,140 m."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could Arenal erupt again?",
      "answer": "Yes, volcanologists consider another eruption at Arenal highly probable. The volcano has a well-documented 7,000-year history showing cyclic behavior: major explosive eruptions (VEI 4) occur every 300–500 years, separated by periods of effusive cone-building and quiescence. The 1968–2010 eruption represents the most recent effusive phase. The current quiet period, beginning in 2010, may last years or decades before the next eruption. The prehistoric record suggests the next major event could be a VEI 4 eruption significantly more powerful than the 1968 opening (VEI 3). Continuous monitoring by OVSICORI-UNA should detect precursory seismic unrest and ground deformation weeks to months before an eruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Arenal stop erupting in 2010?",
      "answer": "Arenal's eruption gradually waned through the late 2000s as the supply of magma to the shallow reservoir diminished. By mid-2010, Strombolian explosions had ceased, lava extrusion had stopped, and seismic activity dropped to background levels. The 42-year eruption likely ended because the batch of magma feeding the eruption was largely depleted — not because the underlying magmatic system has shut down permanently. This pattern is consistent with Arenal's prehistoric record, which shows alternating active and quiet phases. The current repose allows the deep magmatic system to potentially recharge for a future eruption. Similar post-eruption quiet periods at other volcanoes have lasted from years to centuries."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is La Fortuna safe from Arenal Volcano?",
      "answer": "La Fortuna is at moderate volcanic risk. The town lies approximately 6 km east of Arenal's summit, within the potential hazard zone for pyroclastic flows from a major eruption. The 1968 eruption demonstrated that directed blasts can devastate areas up to 5 km from the crater; a VEI 4 event (consistent with Arenal's prehistoric record) could generate pyroclastic flows reaching or approaching La Fortuna. However, the 1968 blasts were directed westward, away from the town. OVSICORI-UNA and Costa Rica's Comisión Nacional de Emergencias maintain monitoring and evacuation plans. Current volcanic alert is Green (normal background activity), and precursory seismic unrest would likely provide days to weeks of warning before any eruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the best hot springs near Arenal?",
      "answer": "Several hot spring complexes on and near Arenal's flanks are heated by residual volcanic activity. Tabacón Grand Spa & Thermal Resort, on the northern flank, is the most famous and features a river of naturally heated water flowing through tropical gardens. Baldi Hot Springs offers over 25 pools at varying temperatures. Ecotermales is a smaller, less crowded option popular with locals. The Springs Resort provides luxury pools with direct volcano views. Free natural hot springs exist along the Río Chollin near Tabacón. Water temperatures range from 25°C to 65°C (77–149°F) depending on proximity to the volcanic heat source. These springs will continue functioning regardless of the volcano's eruptive state."
