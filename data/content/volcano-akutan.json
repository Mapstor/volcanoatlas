      "content": "Akutan is an active <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> on Akutan Island in the eastern Aleutian Islands, rising to 1,303 m (4,275 ft) approximately 1,200 km southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, in the <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-united-states\">United States</a>. With 47 recorded eruptions, it is one of the most frequently active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc, a chain of more than 50 historically active volcanoes stretching 2,500 km across the northern Pacific as part of the <a href=\"/ring-of-fire\">Ring of Fire</a>. The volcano is distinguished by a 2 km wide summit caldera formed during a major VEI 5 eruption around 340 CE, within which a large cinder cone has become the primary source of modern eruptive activity. Though remote, Akutan Island hosts a small Unangan (Aleut) community and one of the largest commercial fishing ports in North America, placing both people and critical infrastructure within the volcano's hazard zone. Akutan's eruption frequency in the 20th century — particularly from the 1970s through the 1990s with near-annual explosive episodes — places it alongside <a href=\"/volcano/shishaldin\">Shishaldin</a> and <a href=\"/volcano/pavlof\">Pavlof</a> as one of the Aleutian arc's most reliably active volcanoes."

    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Akutan lies along the Aleutian Volcanic Arc, formed by the northwestward subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate at a rate of approximately 7 cm per year. The volcano is built primarily of basaltic to picritic lavas, reflecting its position above relatively thin intermediate crust (15–25 km thick). The current edifice is constructed atop an older, largely buried caldera of late Pleistocene or early Holocene age. The younger, more prominent caldera — approximately 2 km wide and 60–365 m deep — formed during a major explosive eruption approximately 1,600 years ago (around 340 CE), rated VEI 5. This event produced extensive pyroclastic deposits found across the island. Within this younger caldera, a large cinder cone has grown in the northeastern sector and has been the source of most historical eruptions. At least three lakes occupy the caldera floor. Two additional volcanic centers lie on the northwest flank: Lava Peak (Pleistocene age) and a more recent cinder cone that produced a lava flow in 1852, which extended the shoreline to form Lava Point. Fumaroles persist at the base of the caldera cinder cone, and hot springs occur northeast of the caldera along Hot Springs Bay valley."

    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "Akutan's eruption record spans more than 9,000 years, from prehistoric activity around 7620 BCE to its most recent eruption in 1992. The caldera-forming VEI 5 eruption around 340 CE was the most powerful event in the volcano's history. Historical records begin with uncertain reports in the 1790s, and confirmed eruptions have been documented from 1848 onward. The late 20th century was an exceptionally active period: between 1973 and 1992, Akutan erupted nearly every year, producing a sustained series of VEI 2 Strombolian and Vulcanian explosions from the caldera cinder cone. These eruptions were typically characterized by ash plumes rising several kilometers, incandescent ejections visible at night, and occasional lava effusion onto the caldera floor. Since 1992, the volcano has been relatively quiet but remains closely monitored by the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO)."

The eruption generated voluminous pyroclastic flows and tephra deposits that blanketed much of Akutan Island. The caldera collapse left a depression 60–365 m deep, which subsequently filled partially with water to form several lakes. This event was comparable in scale to other major Aleutian caldera-forming eruptions and significantly reshaped the upper portion of the volcanic edifice."

          "content": "A notable eruption from a flank cinder cone on the northwest side of the volcano produced a lava flow that traveled downslope and extended the island's coastline, forming the feature known today as Lava Point. This event is significant as one of the few Akutan eruptions to have produced substantial lava flows outside the summit caldera and demonstrates that eruptive vents are not limited to the caldera cinder cone."

          "content": "The 1978 eruption (VEI 2) is notable for producing a lava flow that traveled through a narrow breach in the north caldera rim, extending nearly to the coast. This event demonstrated that lava flows from the intra-caldera cinder cone could escape the caldera enclosure and potentially threaten areas outside the summit region. The eruption was accompanied by Strombolian explosions and ash emissions typical of Akutan's modern activity style."

          "content": "From 1973 through 1992, Akutan erupted in almost every year — a remarkable sequence of persistent activity. These eruptions were consistently rated VEI 2, featuring Strombolian explosions, ash plumes, and incandescent ejections from the caldera cinder cone. While individually modest, the cumulative effect of nearly 20 consecutive years of activity made Akutan one of the most reliable erupting volcanoes in Alaska during this period. Ash clouds occasionally disrupted aviation routes in the North Pacific, and AVO maintained elevated monitoring throughout the sequence."

    },
    "current_status_and_monitoring": {
      "content": "Since its last confirmed eruption in 1992, Akutan has remained in a state of relative quiescence, though fumarolic activity and elevated temperatures at the summit caldera and Hot Springs Bay persist. The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) monitors Akutan with a network of seismometers, GPS stations, and satellite-based remote sensing. The volcano's aviation color code has generally remained at Green (normal background activity), though brief elevations have occurred during periods of increased seismicity. A significant earthquake swarm struck the region in 1996, raising concerns about a possible eruption, but no surface volcanic activity followed. Akutan is classified as a high-priority volcano for monitoring given its eruption frequency and proximity to critical fishing infrastructure."

    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "While Akutan Island has a small permanent population (approximately 75 in the village of Akutan), the presence of one of North America's largest seafood processing plants significantly increases the number of people at risk, particularly during the summer fishing season when hundreds of workers are present. Primary hazards include ashfall, pyroclastic flows from the caldera, lava flows (which have breached the caldera rim in the past), and lahars generated by the interaction of hot volcanic material with snow and ice cover. Aviation hazards are also significant, as Akutan lies near major North Pacific flight routes connecting North America and Asia. Ash clouds from even modest VEI 2 eruptions can disrupt these routes. AVO has produced hazard assessments and maintains communication protocols with the Federal Aviation Administration. The village's relative distance (~13 km east of the summit) provides some buffer from direct pyroclastic hazards, but ashfall and lahars transported along drainages remain credible threats."

    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "Akutan Island, roughly 30 km long and 20 km wide, is one of the larger islands in the eastern Aleutian chain. The volcanic summit at 1,303 m (4,275 ft) is typically draped in snow and ice, with small glaciers occupying cirques on the upper flanks. The 2 km wide caldera is the volcano's most distinctive feature, containing the large cinder cone, several small lakes, and active fumarolic fields. Hot Springs Bay, on the northeast coast, features geothermal springs fed by volcanic heat. The landscape is typical of the windswept Aleutians: treeless tundra with grasses and low shrubs, steep coastal cliffs, and frequent fog and precipitation. The island's coastline is deeply indented with bays and harbors, including the protected harbor at Akutan village."

    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "Akutan has been home to the Unangan (Aleut) people for thousands of years. The village of Akutan is one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the Aleutian Islands, and the volcano's hot springs have been used by indigenous inhabitants since long before European contact. The Russian name Akutan derives from the Aleut language. The island's modern economy is dominated by commercial fishing, with the Trident Seafoods processing plant being the largest employer. The volcano's persistent activity is a part of daily life for residents, who live with the awareness of its potential hazards."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Akutan volcano still active?",
      "answer": "Yes, Akutan is classified as an active volcano by the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO). Although its last confirmed eruption occurred in 1992, the volcano maintains persistent fumarolic activity within its summit caldera and at Hot Springs Bay. With 47 recorded eruptions — including near-annual activity from 1973 to 1992 — Akutan is one of the most frequently active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc. AVO monitors the volcano continuously and considers future eruptions likely."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did Akutan last erupt?",
      "answer": "Akutan's most recent confirmed eruption occurred in 1992. The eruption was a VEI 2 Strombolian event from the cinder cone within the summit caldera, consistent with the volcano's typical activity pattern. Prior to 1992, Akutan had erupted nearly every year for two decades, and the current quiet period of more than 30 years represents the longest repose in its modern record."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall is Akutan volcano?",
      "answer": "Akutan's summit stands at 1,303 m (4,275 ft) above sea level. However, the total height of the volcanic edifice from the seafloor is approximately 4,500 m, as the volcano rises from deep ocean floor typical of the Aleutian arc region. Compared to its famous neighbor Shishaldin at 2,857 m, Akutan is a considerably shorter but much more frequently eruptive volcano."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do people live near Akutan volcano?",
      "answer": "Yes, the village of Akutan — one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the Aleutian Islands — is located approximately 13 km east of the summit with a permanent population of about 75. The island also hosts a major Trident Seafoods processing plant that employs hundreds of seasonal workers during the summer fishing season, significantly increasing the population at risk during peak periods."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of volcano is Akutan?",
      "answer": "Akutan is a stratovolcano (composite volcano) composed primarily of basaltic to picritic lavas. Its most distinctive feature is a 2 km wide summit caldera formed during a VEI 5 eruption approximately 1,600 years ago. A large cinder cone within the caldera has been the source of most historical eruptions. This caldera-within-a-stratovolcano configuration is relatively common in the Aleutian arc."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Akutan volcano dangerous to aircraft?",
      "answer": "Yes, Akutan lies near major North Pacific aviation routes connecting North America and Asia. Even VEI 2 eruptions can produce ash plumes that reach altitudes hazardous to aircraft. The Alaska Volcano Observatory coordinates with the Federal Aviation Administration and Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers to issue warnings when eruptions produce ash clouds. During the 1973–1992 period of frequent activity, aviation alerts were issued regularly."
