    "overview": {
      "content": "El Salvador has 16 Holocene volcanoes concentrated along a 160-km volcanic front that runs roughly parallel to the Pacific coast, making it one of the most volcanically dense countries on Earth relative to its size. With an area of just 21,041 km² — the smallest country in Central America — El Salvador averages approximately one volcano for every 1,315 km² of territory, a ratio exceeded by few nations anywhere. The country's volcanic chain forms part of the broader [[special:ring-of-fire|Central American Volcanic Arc]], generated by the subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate at a convergence rate of roughly 7–8 cm per year. Five of El Salvador's volcanoes have erupted in recorded history, producing a combined total of 112 confirmed eruptions in the Smithsonian database. The most catastrophic event in the country's volcanic record was the Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption of [[volcano:ilopango|Ilopango]] caldera around 450 CE, a [[special:volcanic-explosivity-index|VEI 6]] event that devastated early Mayan settlements across a wide swath of what is now western El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, and southern Honduras. Today, more than 6.5 million people — virtually the entire national population — live within 40 km of at least one active volcanic center, making volcanic hazard management a persistent priority. The country's volcanic soils, enriched by millennia of tephra deposits, also sustain much of El Salvador's agricultural economy, particularly its renowned coffee plantations on the slopes of Santa Ana and San Salvador."

    "why_el_salvador_has_volcanoes": {
      "content": "El Salvador's volcanic activity is driven entirely by subduction tectonics. The Cocos Plate, a segment of oceanic lithosphere generated at the East Pacific Rise, descends beneath the Caribbean Plate along the Middle America Trench, which lies approximately 100–150 km offshore. As the subducting slab reaches depths of 80–150 km, hydrous minerals in the oceanic crust release water into the overlying mantle wedge, lowering the peridotite's melting point and generating magma that rises through the continental crust to feed the chain of volcanic centers at the surface. This process creates what volcanologists call the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA), a belt of over 100 Quaternary volcanic centers stretching approximately 1,500 km from Guatemala's border with Mexico to central Costa Rica. El Salvador occupies one of the most active segments of the CAVA. The volcanic front in El Salvador lies within the Central Graben, a tectonic depression bounded by northwest-trending normal faults that have been active since the Pliocene. This extensional regime — unusual in a compressional subduction setting — creates additional pathways for magma ascent and contributes to the formation of large calderas like [[volcano:ilopango|Ilopango]] and [[volcano:coatepeque-caldera|Coatepeque]]. The dominant magma compositions range from basaltic andesite to andesite at the stratovolcanoes, with more evolved dacitic and rhyolitic magmas produced by the caldera systems. This compositional diversity reflects varying degrees of fractional crystallization and crustal assimilation as magmas stall and differentiate in the relatively thick continental crust beneath El Salvador."

    "major_volcanoes": {
      "content": "**San Miguel (Chaparrastique)** — Rising to 2,130 m (6,988 ft) in the eastern part of the country, [[volcano:san-miguel|San Miguel]] is El Salvador's most active volcano with 41 confirmed eruptions dating back to the early 16th century. Known locally as Chaparrastique, this symmetrical [[special:types-of-volcanoes|stratovolcano]] produced its most recent eruption in 2023 and has a long history of summit ash emissions, Strombolian activity, and flank lava flows. Several of the SE-flank flows are among the largest in the country, forming broad, sparsely vegetated lava fields. Approximately 500,000 people live within the broader hazard zone, and the city of San Miguel (population ~250,000) lies just 11 km to the northwest.\n\n**Izalco** — Perhaps the country's most iconic volcano, [[volcano:izalco|Izalco]] is a remarkably young stratovolcano that began growing in 1770 CE on the southern flank of Santa Ana. Over the following two centuries, frequent Strombolian eruptions — 51 confirmed events in total — produced a nighttime beacon visible to ships offshore, earning it the name \"El Faro\" (the Lighthouse of the Pacific). Izalco rises to 1,950 m (6,398 ft) and ceased its persistent activity in 1966. The steep, barren cone remains largely unvegetated and stands in dramatic contrast to the forested slopes of its parent volcano.\n\n**Santa Ana (Ilamatepec)** — At 2,381 m (7,812 ft), [[volcano:santa-ana|Santa Ana]] is the tallest volcano in El Salvador and the dominant peak along the western segment of the volcanic front. This massive andesitic stratovolcano has produced 13 confirmed eruptions since 1521, with VEI 3 events recorded in 1874, 1880, and most recently in 2005, when a phreatomagmatic explosion from the summit crater lake ejected hot mud and rock that killed two people and displaced thousands. A late Pleistocene collapse generated a voluminous debris avalanche that reached the Pacific Ocean, forming the Acajutla Peninsula. The broad summit is cut by multiple crescentic craters, and a 20-km fissure system extends to the northwest and southeast.\n\n**San Salvador (Boquerón)** — The massive compound volcano that dominates the skyline west of the capital city, [[volcano:san-salvador|San Salvador]] consists of the Boquerón stratovolcano built within a 6-km-wide caldera. The summit is truncated by a steep-walled crater 1.5 km wide and approximately 500 m deep, formed during a major VEI 4 eruption around 1200 CE. The most recent eruption in 1917 produced both summit and flank activity, including a lava flow on the northern flank. With the San Salvador metropolitan area (population ~2.5 million) draped across the volcano's lower slopes, it ranks among the most hazardous volcanic settings in Latin America.\n\n**Ilopango** — The 8 × 11 km [[volcano:ilopango|Ilopango]] caldera, filled by one of El Salvador's largest lakes, is the site of the most powerful eruption in Central American recorded history. The Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption of approximately 450 CE was a VEI 6 event that produced pyroclastic flows extending up to 40 km from the caldera, deposited ash across much of Central America, and is thought to have caused the collapse or relocation of major Mayan population centers. The caldera lies immediately east of San Salvador, and post-caldera volcanism formed the Islas Quemadas lava domes during the most recent eruption in 1879–1880.\n\n**Coatepeque Caldera** — This 6.5-km-wide caldera occupies the area between [[volcano:santa-ana|Santa Ana]] and San Salvador, filled by the scenic Lago de Coatepeque. Formed by major Plinian eruptions during the late Pleistocene that deposited thick ignimbrite sheets across western El Salvador, Coatepeque has not erupted in the Holocene. However, active fumarolic areas on the lake floor indicate that the magmatic system remains warm.\n\n**Tecapa** — Rising to 1,593 m (5,226 ft) in the Usulután department, [[volcano:tecapa|Tecapa]] is a stratovolcano with prominent flank fumarolic areas including the Berlín geothermal field, which generates a significant portion of El Salvador's electricity. No eruptions have been confirmed during the Holocene, but the vigorous hydrothermal activity suggests an active magmatic source at depth.\n\n**San Vicente (Chichontepec)** — At 2,149 m (7,051 ft), San Vicente is El Salvador's second tallest volcano. This twin-peaked stratovolcano has no confirmed Holocene eruptions but remains classified as a potential hazard due to its steep slopes and proximity to the city of San Vicente. In 2001, the earthquake-triggered Jiboa River lahar on the volcano's flanks killed over 500 people, underscoring the hazard posed even by volcanoes without recent eruptive activity."

    "eruption_history": {
      "content": "El Salvador's eruption record spans millennia, with 112 confirmed eruptions across five volcanoes in the Smithsonian database. The most devastating event in the country's volcanic history was the Tierra Blanca Joven eruption of [[volcano:ilopango|Ilopango]] caldera around 450 CE. This [[special:volcanic-explosivity-index|VEI 6]] cataclysm — the only eruption of that magnitude in Central America during the Holocene — ejected approximately 44 km³ of tephra, buried much of central and western El Salvador under thick deposits of white pumice, and generated pyroclastic flows that traveled tens of kilometers from the caldera. Archaeologists have linked the TBJ eruption to the abandonment of the Mayan city of Chalchuapa and widespread population displacement across the region. Radiocarbon dating of the event correlates with a period of anomalous climate conditions recorded in Greenland ice cores, suggesting the eruption injected sufficient sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere to produce detectable hemispheric cooling.\n\nThe historical record (post-1521 CE, following the Spanish Conquest) is dominated by the persistent activity of [[volcano:izalco|Izalco]] and [[volcano:san-miguel|San Miguel]]. Izalco's nearly continuous Strombolian eruptions from 1770 to 1966 account for 51 of the country's 112 confirmed eruptions, making it one of the most frequently active volcanoes in the Americas during that period. San Miguel has produced 41 confirmed eruptions since 1510, including frequent 19th-century flank lava flows and recurring summit ash emissions continuing into the 21st century. The 1917 eruption of [[volcano:san-salvador|San Salvador]] was particularly destructive: lava poured down the northern flank toward the Nejapa valley, and the eruption formed a small cinder cone on the floor of the Boquerón crater, which had previously contained a crater lake. The 2005 eruption of [[volcano:santa-ana|Santa Ana]] was the country's most significant 21st-century event prior to San Miguel's 2013 and 2023 activity — a phreatomagmatic explosion from the summit crater lake that killed two people and forced the evacuation of surrounding communities."

    "volcanic_hazards": {
      "content": "El Salvador faces a uniquely concentrated volcanic hazard profile. The country's small size, high population density (over 300 people per km²), and dense volcanic chain mean that virtually every citizen lives within reach of at least one volcanic hazard zone. The primary threats include pyroclastic flows and surges, particularly from caldera-forming eruptions at systems like [[volcano:ilopango|Ilopango]]; tephra fall that can collapse roofs and contaminate water supplies across wide areas; lava flows from flank eruptions, especially at [[volcano:san-miguel|San Miguel]]; and lahars (volcanic mudflows) triggered by rainfall remobilizing loose tephra deposits on steep volcanic slopes. The 2001 earthquake-triggered lahar on [[volcano:san-vicente|San Vicente]] demonstrated that even volcanoes without recent eruptions pose serious mass-movement hazards. Volcanic gas emissions, particularly SO₂, are monitored at San Miguel and Santa Ana, where degassing from summit craters is persistent. El Salvador's volcanic hazard monitoring is coordinated by the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (MARN), which operates a network of seismometers, gas sensors, and webcams at the country's most active centers. International collaboration with USGS, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Central American Seismological Center (CASC) has strengthened monitoring capabilities significantly since the 2005 Santa Ana eruption."

    "volcanic_zones_map": {
      "content": "El Salvador's 16 volcanoes are distributed along a remarkably linear volcanic front that trends roughly WNW–ESE across the southern half of the country, parallel to the Pacific coast and approximately 170–200 km from the Middle America Trench. The chain lies within the Central Graben, a structural trough bounded by subparallel normal faults. From west to east, the volcanic front can be divided into three segments: the western segment (Apaneca Range, [[volcano:santa-ana|Santa Ana]], [[volcano:izalco|Izalco]], [[volcano:coatepeque-caldera|Coatepeque]]), the central segment ([[volcano:san-salvador|San Salvador]], [[volcano:ilopango|Ilopango]], San Vicente), and the eastern segment (Tecapa, Usulután, Chinameca, [[volcano:san-miguel|San Miguel]]). The highest concentration of eruptions occurs at the ends of this chain — the west (Santa Ana/Izalco complex) and the east (San Miguel) — while the central segment is dominated by the large calderas of Ilopango and San Salvador. The greatest population exposure is in the central segment, where the capital San Salvador sits between the Boquerón stratovolcano and the Ilopango caldera."

    "impact_on_culture_and_economy": {
      "content": "Volcanic activity has shaped Salvadoran civilization for millennia. The TBJ eruption of [[volcano:ilopango|Ilopango]] around 450 CE is considered one of the formative events of Mesoamerican history, disrupting Maya settlement patterns across the southeastern lowlands and depositing the distinctive white tephra layer that archaeologists use as a chronological marker throughout the region. The archaeological site of Joya de Cerén, a Mayan farming village buried by a later eruption of the Loma Caldera (a satellite vent of San Salvador) around 660 CE, has been designated a [[ext:https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/675|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] and is often called the \"Pompeii of the Americas\" for its extraordinary preservation of daily life. Modern El Salvador derives significant economic benefit from its volcanic geology. The Berlín geothermal field on the flanks of [[volcano:tecapa|Tecapa]] and the Ahuachapán geothermal plant near the Apaneca Range together contribute approximately 25% of the country's electricity generation, making El Salvador one of the highest per-capita producers of geothermal energy in the world. The fertile volcanic soils on the slopes of Santa Ana and San Salvador support the country's coffee industry, which remains a pillar of the agricultural economy. Volcanic crater lakes, particularly Lago de Coatepeque and Laguna de Alegría (in the Tecapa crater), are popular domestic tourism destinations."

    "visiting_volcanoes": {
      "content": "El Salvador's compact geography and well-maintained road network make its volcanoes surprisingly accessible for visitors. The most popular volcanic hike is the ascent of [[volcano:santa-ana|Santa Ana (Ilamatepec)]], where a well-marked trail from Cerro Verde National Park leads to the summit crater in approximately 2–3 hours, rewarding hikers with views of the vivid turquoise crater lake and panoramic vistas extending to the Pacific Ocean and Lago de Coatepeque below. Guided group hikes (mandated for safety since 2005) typically depart on weekends. [[volcano:izalco|Izalco]] can also be climbed from Cerro Verde — the steep, barren cone offers a more challenging scramble over loose cinders with dramatic views of the scorched summit crater. The Cerro Verde area itself sits at 2,030 m and offers a visitor center, orchid garden, and moderate trails through cloud forest. San Miguel (Chaparrastique) is accessible by trail but should only be attempted when MARN alert levels permit, given its frequent activity. Joya de Cerén, the UNESCO-listed buried Mayan village, lies near San Salvador and provides a unique window into volcanic catastrophe in the pre-Columbian world. For a more relaxed experience, Lago de Coatepeque offers lakeside restaurants and hotels with views of [[volcano:santa-ana|Santa Ana]] and [[volcano:izalco|Izalco]] rising above the caldera rim."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How many volcanoes are in El Salvador?",
      "answer": "El Salvador has 16 Holocene volcanoes catalogued in the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program database. Of these, five have confirmed historical eruptions: San Miguel (Chaparrastique), Izalco, Santa Ana (Ilamatepec), San Salvador (Boquerón), and Ilopango. The seemingly low total belies the country's extraordinary volcanic density — with a land area of just 21,041 km², El Salvador has roughly one volcano per 1,315 km², one of the highest ratios of any country. The number of individual volcanic vents and satellite cones is considerably higher; the 20-km fissure system associated with Santa Ana alone contains numerous subsidiary cones and craters."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the most active volcano in El Salvador?",
      "answer": "San Miguel (Chaparrastique) is El Salvador's most active volcano, with 41 confirmed eruptions in the Smithsonian database — the highest count of any volcano in Central America. Activity has been recorded since the early 16th century, ranging from large flank lava flows in the 17th through 19th centuries to summit ash emissions and Strombolian explosions in the 20th and 21st centuries. The most recent eruption occurred in 2023. The volcano's location near the city of San Miguel (population approximately 250,000) makes its monitoring a national priority."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the tallest volcano in El Salvador?",
      "answer": "Santa Ana (Ilamatepec) is the tallest volcano in El Salvador at 2,381 m (7,812 ft) above sea level. It is a massive stratovolcano located in the western part of the country, and its broad summit is cut by several nested craters, the innermost of which contains a hot, acidic crater lake. Santa Ana is followed in height by San Vicente (Chichontepec) at 2,149 m (7,051 ft) and San Miguel (Chaparrastique) at 2,130 m (6,988 ft). Despite being the tallest, Santa Ana is only the third most active; its 13 confirmed eruptions are well behind San Miguel's 41 and Izalco's 51."
    },
    {
      "question": "When was the last volcanic eruption in El Salvador?",
      "answer": "The most recent volcanic eruption in El Salvador was at San Miguel (Chaparrastique) in 2023, which produced ash emissions from the summit crater. Prior to this, San Miguel erupted in 2013 in a VEI 3 event that sent an ash column approximately 5 km above the summit and prompted the evacuation of around 5,000 people from surrounding communities. Before San Miguel's recent activity, the 2005 eruption of Santa Ana was the country's last significant event — a phreatomagmatic explosion that killed two people and caused widespread ash and mud deposition."
    },
    {
      "question": "What was El Salvador's worst volcanic eruption?",
      "answer": "The worst volcanic eruption in El Salvador's history was the Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption of the Ilopango caldera around 450 CE. This VEI 6 event — the only eruption of that magnitude in Central American recorded history — ejected approximately 44 km³ of tephra, generated devastating pyroclastic flows that traveled up to 40 km from the caldera, and buried much of central and western El Salvador under thick white pumice deposits. The eruption devastated Mayan settlements across the region and is linked to widespread population displacement. The exact death toll is unknown, but archaeologists consider it one of the most destructive volcanic events in pre-Columbian American history."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to visit volcanoes in El Salvador?",
      "answer": "Yes, visiting volcanoes in El Salvador is generally safe when following established guidelines. The most popular volcanic hike — the ascent of Santa Ana (Ilamatepec) from Cerro Verde National Park — requires joining an organized, guided group hike, a safety measure implemented after the 2005 eruption. The hike takes approximately 2-3 hours to the summit. Izalco can also be climbed from Cerro Verde. Visitors should always check current MARN (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales) alert levels before attempting any volcanic hike, and San Miguel should only be visited when the alert level permits. Road infrastructure is good, and most volcanic areas are within 1-3 hours of San Salvador."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does El Salvador have so many volcanoes?",
      "answer": "El Salvador's volcanoes exist because the country sits directly above a subduction zone where the Cocos Plate — a segment of the Pacific oceanic floor — dives beneath the Caribbean Plate along the Middle America Trench approximately 100-150 km offshore. As the subducting slab descends to depths of 80-150 km, water released from the oceanic crust lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle, generating magma that rises to feed the volcanic chain at the surface. El Salvador occupies one of the most active segments of the 1,500-km-long Central American Volcanic Arc, and the additional influence of extensional faulting within the Central Graben creates extra pathways for magma ascent."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Lighthouse of the Pacific?",
      "answer": "The 'Lighthouse of the Pacific' (El Faro del Pacífico) is a nickname for Izalco volcano in western El Salvador. Born in 1770 CE as a new vent on the southern flank of Santa Ana, Izalco erupted with such remarkable frequency and consistency over the next 196 years that its nighttime glow of incandescent lava and hot ejecta was visible from the Pacific Ocean and reportedly used by sailors as a navigational reference. Izalco produced 51 confirmed eruptions before its activity ceased in 1966. The steep, 1,950-m-tall cinder cone remains largely barren and unvegetated, a stark visual reminder of its recent formation."
