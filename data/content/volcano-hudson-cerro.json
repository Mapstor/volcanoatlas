    "overview": {
      "content": "Cerro Hudson is a massive <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> crowned by a 10-km-wide ice-filled caldera in the remote Aysén Region of southern <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-chile\">Chile</a>, making it the southernmost volcano in the Chilean Andes related to subduction of the Nazca Plate. Rising to only 1,905 m (6,250 ft) — modest by Andean standards — the volcano's low profile and ice-covered summit concealed its true nature for decades; the caldera was not even recognized as volcanic until the explosive eruption of 1971. This obscurity belies a formidable eruptive history. Cerro Hudson has produced two confirmed <a href=\"/volcanic-explosivity-index\">VEI</a> 6 eruptions during the Holocene — around 4750 BCE and 1890 BCE — each generating more than 10 km³ of tephra, placing them among the largest explosive events in the southern Andes over the past 10,000 years. The devastating VEI 5 eruption of August 1991 was one of the most significant volcanic events of the late 20th century, depositing ash across Patagonia and as far as the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), killing over one million livestock, and causing an estimated $50 million in agricultural losses. The massive edifice covers approximately 300 km², and its compound caldera is breached to the northwest, channeling meltwater and potential lahars down the Río de Los Huemeles. With 15 recorded eruptions spanning 10,000 years and a demonstrated capacity for globally significant explosive events, Cerro Hudson ranks among the most dangerous volcanoes in South America."
    },
    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Cerro Hudson sits at the southern terminus of the Chilean Andean volcanic arc, where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate at approximately 45.9°S latitude. This position places it near the Chile Triple Junction, where the Nazca, Antarctic, and South American plates converge — a geologically complex setting that influences the volcano's magmatic composition and behavior. Despite the tectonic complexity, Hudson's primary volcanic driver is conventional subduction zone magmatism. The volcano has been built over multiple eruptive cycles, constructing a broad edifice covering approximately 300 km². The dominant rock type is basaltic to picritic basalt, unusually mafic for a stratovolcano capable of such large explosive eruptions. This compositional paradox — highly explosive behavior from relatively primitive magma — has been attributed to the interaction of rising magma with the extensive glacial ice cap filling the caldera, which amplifies explosive fragmentation through phreatomagmatic processes. The 10-km-wide caldera is a compound structure formed through multiple collapse events associated with the major Holocene eruptions. The caldera is breached to the northwest, where the Río de Los Huemeles drains the ice-filled basin. Two cinder cones sit north of the main edifice, while additional cones occupy the southwest and southeast flanks."

    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "Cerro Hudson's eruptive record spans at least 10,000 years, with 15 confirmed eruptions in the Smithsonian database. The volcano's Holocene history is dominated by two colossal eruptions: a VEI 6 event around 4750 BCE and another VEI 6 event around 1890 BCE, each producing more than 10 km³ of tephra. Additional prehistoric eruptions are recorded around 8010 BCE, 4960 BCE, 3890 BCE, 2250 BCE, 790 BCE, 120 BCE, 390 CE, and 860 CE. Historical eruptions in 1740 and 1891 preceded the 20th-century awakening, which began with the 1971 eruption (VEI 3) that first revealed the caldera. The catastrophic 1991 eruption (VEI 5) remains the defining event in modern Chilean volcanology, and the most recent eruption in October 2011 (VEI 2) confirmed continued activity."

This VEI 6 event ejected more than 10 km³ of tephra, generating massive pyroclastic flows and blanketing Patagonia under thick ash deposits. Tephra from this eruption has been identified in sediment cores across southern Chile and Argentina, serving as a critical chronostratigraphic marker for dating other geological and archaeological events in the region. The eruption likely contributed to caldera collapse, enlarging the summit depression. At VEI 6, this event was comparable in magnitude to the 1883 eruption of <a href=\"/volcano/krakatau\">Krakatau</a> or the 1991 eruption of <a href=\"/volcano/pinatubo\">Pinatubo</a> — placing Cerro Hudson in an elite category of Holocene volcanic producers."

The VEI 3 eruption produced explosive columns, ashfall, and significant lahars that swept down the Río de Los Huemeles as volcanic heat melted caldera ice. The lahars caused damage downstream and alerted Chilean authorities to the presence of a dangerous volcanic system that had been hidden beneath its glacial cap.

Coming just months after the VEI 6 eruption of <a href=\"/volcano/pinatubo\">Mount Pinatubo</a> in the Philippines, Hudson's VEI 5 event generated comparatively less global attention, but its regional impact was devastating. The eruption proceeded in two main phases. The first phase on August 8–9 was a lateral blast from the northwest caldera rim, producing pyroclastic flows and heavy ashfall over a northwest sector. A brief pause was followed by the climactic second phase beginning August 12, when a massive Plinian column rose to approximately 16–18 km altitude. Winds carried the eruption plume eastward, depositing a thick blanket of ash across Argentine Patagonia, reaching the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) over 1,000 km to the east. The eruption formed a new 800-m-wide crater in the southwest portion of the caldera. Total tephra volume was approximately 4 km³. Over one million sheep and cattle perished from ingesting ash-contaminated pasture, with an estimated $50 million in livestock losses. Ashfall exceeded 10 cm across vast areas of Argentine Patagonia. The eruption's sulfur loading combined with <a href=\"/volcano/pinatubo\">Pinatubo's</a> contributed to measurable global temperature reduction in 1992–1993."

SERNAGEOMIN monitors the volcano using seismometers, webcams, and satellite-based thermal and gas detection systems. Hudson's extremely remote location — approximately 140 km south of Coyhaique — makes ground-based monitoring more challenging than for Chile's more accessible northern volcanoes.

Ashfall is the most wide-reaching hazard; the 1991 eruption deposited ash across all of Argentine Patagonia and reached the Falkland Islands. Pyroclastic flows from major eruptions could travel tens of kilometers from the caldera. Lahars represent a serious downstream threat — the ice-filled caldera provides abundant meltwater channeled through the northwest breach down the Río de Los Huemeles.

    {
      "question": "What happened during the 1991 Cerro Hudson eruption?",
      "answer": "The August 1991 eruption of Cerro Hudson was a VEI 5 event and one of the largest volcanic eruptions of the late 20th century. It proceeded in two phases: a lateral blast on August 8–9 followed by a climactic Plinian eruption on August 12 that sent an ash column 16–18 km high.

Having two VEI 6 events in its Holocene record makes Cerro Hudson one of the most explosively productive volcanoes in all of South America."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where is Cerro Hudson located?",
      "answer": "Cerro Hudson is located in the Aysén Region of southern Chile at 45.9°S latitude, making it the southernmost subduction-related volcano in the Chilean Andes. The nearest city is Coyhaique, approximately 140 km to the north. The volcano sits in an extremely remote area of Patagonia, surrounded by temperate rainforest and accessible only by challenging overland routes. Its position near the Chile Triple Junction, where three tectonic plates converge, places it in a geologically complex setting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was Cerro Hudson's caldera not discovered until 1971?",
      "answer": "Cerro Hudson's 10-km-wide caldera remained unrecognized because it is completely filled with glacial ice and snow, giving the mountain an unremarkable appearance indistinguishable from surrounding non-volcanic peaks. The remote location in southern Chilean Patagonia, with difficult access and sparse population, meant that the area received limited geological survey attention. It was only when the explosive 1971 eruption produced ashfall and lahars that scientists investigated and identified the summit depression as a volcanic caldera. The discovery prompted a reassessment of volcanic hazards across the entire Aysén Region."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall is Cerro Hudson?",
      "answer": "Cerro Hudson rises to 1,905 m (6,250 ft) above sea level — surprisingly modest for a volcano capable of such enormous eruptions. Many Andean stratovolcanoes tower above 4,000–6,000 m, but Hudson's relatively low elevation belies its vast footprint (approximately 300 km²) and massive caldera (10 km wide). The low summit height combined with the ice-filled caldera contributed to the volcano remaining unrecognized as volcanic until 1971."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could Cerro Hudson erupt again like 1991?",
      "answer": "Yes, volcanologists consider future large eruptions at Cerro Hudson entirely plausible. The volcano's Holocene record includes two eruptions even larger than the 1991 event — VEI 6 events around 4750 BCE and 1890 BCE. The average recurrence interval between significant eruptions over the past 10,000 years is roughly 700–1,000 years, and it has been only about 30 years since the last major event. A repeat VEI 5 or VEI 6 eruption would have devastating consequences for Patagonia and potentially measurable hemispheric climate effects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What hazards does Cerro Hudson pose?",
      "answer": "Cerro Hudson poses several serious hazards. Ashfall from large eruptions can blanket hundreds of thousands of square kilometers, as the 1991 eruption demonstrated across Argentine Patagonia. Pyroclastic flows from major eruptions could travel tens of kilometers from the caldera. Lahars (volcanic mudflows) are a particular concern because the ice-filled caldera provides abundant meltwater that is channeled through the northwest breach down the Río de Los Huemeles. A VEI 6 eruption could inject enough sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere to produce measurable hemispheric temperature cooling."
