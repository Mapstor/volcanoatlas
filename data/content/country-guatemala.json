      "content": "Guatemala has 18 Holocene volcanoes aligned along the Central America Volcanic Arc, forming one of the most dramatically volcanic landscapes in the Western Hemisphere. The country's volcanic chain runs roughly parallel to the Pacific coast, with towering [[special:types-of-volcanoes|stratovolcanoes]] rising above the densely populated Guatemalan highlands and providing the backdrop to cities, towns, and agricultural communities that have coexisted with volcanic hazards for millennia. Guatemala contains the highest peak in Central America — [[volcano:tajumulco|Tajumulco]] at 4,203 m (13,789 ft) — and one of the most active and dangerous volcanoes in the Americas: [[volcano:fuego|Volcán de Fuego]].\n\nFuego, with 79 recorded eruptions dating back to the pre-Columbian era, is a persistently active volcano whose eruptions are frequently visible from Guatemala City, the nation's capital of approximately 3 million people. The June 3, 2018, pyroclastic flow from Fuego killed at least 190 people (with approximately 234 still missing) in the village of San Miguel Los Lotes — one of the deadliest volcanic disasters in modern Central American history. Meanwhile, [[volcano:santa-maria|Santa Maria]]/Santiaguito has been in near-continuous eruption since 1922, its growing lava dome complex providing volcanologists with one of the world's best-studied examples of long-duration dome-building volcanism.\n\nGuatemala's volcanic heritage extends far beyond Fuego and Santa Maria. The iconic silhouette of [[volcano:agua|Agua]] looms over the UNESCO World Heritage city of Antigua Guatemala, while [[volcano:atitlan|Atitlán]] and [[volcano:toliman|Tolimán]] flank the shores of Lake Atitlán — a caldera lake considered one of the most beautiful in the world. [[volcano:pacaya|Pacaya]], visible from Guatemala City, has been in an active eruptive phase since 1961 and is the country's most popular volcano tourism destination. Compared to neighboring [[country:el-salvador|El Salvador]] (16 volcanoes) and [[country:mexico|Mexico]] (34 volcanoes), Guatemala's 18 volcanoes represent a concentrated zone of high-altitude, high-risk volcanism directly overlapping with dense human settlement."
    },
    "why_guatemala_has_volcanoes": {
      "content": "Guatemala's volcanism is driven by the subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate along the Middle America Trench, which runs parallel to the Pacific coast at a distance of approximately 100–150 km offshore. The Cocos Plate converges with the Caribbean Plate at a rate of approximately 7–8 cm per year, descending at a moderate angle beneath the overriding continental crust. As the oceanic slab reaches depths of 100–200 km, dehydration reactions release water into the overlying mantle wedge, lowering its melting point and generating magma that rises to feed the Central America Volcanic Arc.\n\nGuatemala's position along this arc is particularly significant because the subducting slab passes beneath thick continental crust exceeding 25 km. This thick crustal column gives rising magmas extended residence time in magma chambers, allowing fractional crystallization to produce the dacitic and andesitic compositions that dominate Guatemalan volcanism. These silica-rich, gas-laden magmas are inherently more explosive than the basaltic lavas of oceanic hotspot volcanoes, which explains why Guatemalan eruptions frequently produce pyroclastic flows, heavy ashfall, and violent Plinian columns.\n\nThe volcanic front in Guatemala runs approximately 250 km from Tajumulco in the northwest to Moyuta near the [[country:el-salvador|El Salvador]] border, roughly parallel to the coast at elevations between 1,200 and 4,200 m. The Pleistocene Atitlán caldera, which produced the catastrophic Los Chocoyos eruption approximately 85,000 years ago (one of the largest known eruptions in Central America), demonstrates that Guatemala has the tectonic capacity for truly catastrophic volcanism. Several of the country's modern stratovolcanoes — including Atitlán, Fuego, and Acatenango — were built within or adjacent to this older caldera structure. Guatemala's volcanoes are part of the broader [[special:ring-of-fire|Ring of Fire]], the circum-Pacific belt that hosts approximately 75% of the world's active volcanoes."

    "major_volcanoes": {
      "content": "**Volcán de Fuego** — Guatemala's most active and most dangerous volcano, with 79 recorded eruptions spanning nearly 3,600 years. This 3,799-m (12,464-ft) stratovolcano overlooks the former capital of Antigua Guatemala and produces Vulcanian to sub-Plinian eruptions with pyroclastic flows, lahars, and heavy ashfall. The June 3, 2018, eruption produced a devastating pyroclastic flow that traveled 12 km down the Barranca Las Laújas ravine, burying the village of San Miguel Los Lotes under several meters of volcanic debris. At least 190 people died and approximately 234 remain missing — one of the deadliest volcanic events in the Americas in the 21st century. Fuego entered its current eruptive phase in 2002 and continues to produce explosions, ashfall, and incandescent avalanches visible from Guatemala City. With a maximum VEI of 4, it has the explosive power to produce major Plinian events. [[volcano:fuego|Read the full Fuego profile.]]\n\n**Santa Maria / Santiaguito** — The site of Guatemala's largest historical eruption and one of the world's best-studied dome-building volcanoes. On October 24, 1902, Santa Maria erupted in a VEI 6 Plinian event — one of the largest eruptions of the 20th century — that blasted a 1.5-km-wide crater into its southwestern flank and killed approximately 5,000 people. Beginning in 1922, a new dome complex called Santiaguito began growing within the 1902 crater and has been in near-continuous eruption for over a century. Santiaguito produces dome extrusions, pyroclastic flows, and lahars that periodically threaten communities on the Pacific coastal plain below. At 3,745 m (12,287 ft), the forested summit of Santa Maria contrasts dramatically with the active, steaming dome complex below. [[volcano:santa-maria|Read the full Santa Maria profile.]]\n\n**Pacaya** — A complex basaltic volcano visible from Guatemala City whose eruptions provide some of the most accessible volcanic spectacles in Central America. The MacKenney cone, built within the collapse scar of the older Pacaya Viejo edifice, has been in an active eruptive phase since 1961, with 36 recorded eruptions producing Strombolian fountains, lava flows, and occasional explosive events. The 2010 eruption deposited ash on Guatemala City's international airport, forcing its closure, and ejected ballistic blocks that killed a journalist near the summit. At 2,569 m, Pacaya is a popular hiking destination where visitors can often observe incandescent lava from close range. [[volcano:pacaya|Read the full Pacaya profile.]]\n\n**Tajumulco** — At 4,203 m (13,789 ft), Tajumulco is Guatemala's highest peak and the highest point in all of Central America. This andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano in the northwestern highlands has had only unconfirmed reports of historical eruptions, though two Holocene eruptions are recognized from geological evidence. Despite its relatively quiet recent history, Tajumulco's massive size and position above populated highland valleys make it a significant potential hazard. [[volcano:tajumulco|Read the full Tajumulco profile.]]\n\n**Acatenango** — Rising to 3,976 m (13,045 ft) just 3 km north of Fuego, Acatenango is one of Guatemala's most popular hiking destinations, offering spectacular views of Fuego's frequent eruptions from its summit camp. The volcano's Yepocapa and Pico Central summits have produced 8 recorded eruptions, most recently in 1972. The two-day Acatenango summit hike, with overnight camping to watch Fuego erupt by firelight, has become one of Central America's iconic adventure tourism experiences. [[volcano:acatenango|Read the full Acatenango profile.]]\n\n**Atitlán** — One of several conical stratovolcanoes flanking Lake Atitlán, a Pleistocene caldera lake formed by the catastrophic Los Chocoyos eruption approximately 85,000 years ago. Atitlán rises to 3,535 m (11,598 ft) and has produced 15 eruptions, most recently in 1853. Together with [[volcano:toliman|Tolimán]] (3,158 m), it forms the dramatic volcanic backdrop to one of Guatemala's most important tourist destinations. [[volcano:atitlan|Read the full Atitlán profile.]]\n\n**Agua** — The symmetrical, forest-covered cone of Agua (3,760 m / 12,336 ft) is one of Guatemala's most iconic landmarks, forming an imposing backdrop to the city of Antigua Guatemala. Despite its prominence, Agua has no confirmed Holocene eruptions and is considered dormant or potentially extinct. Its primary hazard is from lahars: in 1541, a catastrophic mudflow from Agua's slopes destroyed the original Spanish colonial capital of Ciudad Vieja, killing hundreds."

    "eruption_history": {
      "content": "Guatemala's volcanoes have collectively produced 148 recorded eruptions, with activity concentrated at three persistently active centers: Fuego (79 eruptions), Pelée-class Mount Pelée (54 eruptions, though that's France), and Pacaya (36 eruptions). The record spans from approximately 1580 BCE to the present day, with the most intense period of recorded activity occurring from the 16th century onward, coinciding with European colonization and the establishment of written historical records.\n\nThe most catastrophic eruption in Guatemala's history was the VEI 6 Plinian eruption of Santa Maria on October 24–26, 1902. The explosion blasted approximately 5.5 km³ of dacitic material from the volcano's southwestern flank, creating a massive eruption column visible across Central America and depositing ash as far as Mexico and Costa Rica. Approximately 5,000 people died, primarily from pyroclastic flows and building collapse under heavy tephra loads. The 1902 eruption occurred just five months after Mount Pelée's catastrophe in Martinique, making 1902 the deadliest year for volcanic disasters in modern history.\n\nFuego's eruption record extends to approximately 1580 BCE, with Spanish colonial records documenting frequent activity from the 16th century onward. The June 3, 2018, eruption stands as the deadliest Guatemalan volcanic event in modern history: pyroclastic flows from a sustained eruption column raced down ravines on Fuego's southern flank, burying communities with virtually no warning time. At least 190 people were killed and approximately 234 remain missing, their bodies unrecoverable beneath meters of volcanic debris. The disaster exposed critical weaknesses in Guatemala's volcanic warning systems and evacuation procedures.\n\nSantiaguito, the dome complex growing within Santa Maria's 1902 crater, has been in near-continuous eruption since 1922 — making it one of the longest-sustained eruptions on Earth at over 100 years. Pacaya's current eruptive phase, beginning in 1961, has produced explosive events visible from Guatemala City and lava flows that periodically threaten communities on the volcano's flanks."
    },
    "volcanic_hazards": {
      "content": "Guatemala faces severe volcanic hazards compounded by high population density, poverty, inadequate warning systems, and the steep terrain that channels pyroclastic flows and lahars through populated valleys. Pyroclastic flows represent the deadliest hazard: the 2018 Fuego disaster demonstrated that flows can travel over 12 km from the summit at speeds exceeding 100 km/h, giving communities in ravine corridors virtually no time to evacuate. The 1902 Santa Maria eruption showed that Guatemala's volcanoes are capable of VEI 6 Plinian events with devastating regional consequences.\n\nLahars (volcanic mudflows) are a chronic hazard, particularly from Fuego and Santiaguito. Heavy rainfall on ash-covered slopes mobilizes volcanic debris into fast-moving slurries that follow river valleys to the heavily populated Pacific coastal plain. The volcanic lahar warning system (INSIVUMEH's network) has been strengthened since 2018, but monitoring capacity remains limited relative to the scale of the threat.\n\nAshfall from Fuego, Pacaya, and Santiaguito periodically affects Guatemala City (population ~3 million), disrupting aviation, contaminating water supplies, and damaging agriculture. The 2010 Pacaya eruption forced the closure of La Aurora International Airport, Guatemala City's main airport. Guatemala's proximity to multiple active volcanoes means that eruption impacts can compound: during periods of simultaneous activity at Fuego and Santiaguito, multiple population centers face concurrent hazards.\n\nThe underlying social vulnerability magnifies volcanic risk. Many communities in high-hazard zones lack paved evacuation routes, and informal settlements have expanded into ravines and drainages that serve as natural channels for pyroclastic flows and lahars. CONRED (Guatemala's disaster coordination agency) and INSIVUMEH (the national seismological and volcanological institute) work to monitor volcanic activity and coordinate evacuations, but resources remain constrained."
    },
    "volcanic_zones_map": {
      "content": "Guatemala's 18 volcanoes form a single volcanic arc running approximately 250 km from northwest to southeast through the country's western highlands, roughly parallel to the Pacific coast. The arc can be divided into three geographic clusters. The northwestern cluster, near the Mexican border, includes Tajumulco (4,203 m) — Central America's highest peak — along with Santa Maria/Santiaguito and Almolonga. The central cluster surrounding Lake Atitlán includes the caldera-rim volcanoes Atitlán, Tolimán, and San Pedro, plus the adjacent Fuego-Acatenango twin complex and the iconic Agua visible from Antigua. The southeastern cluster, extending toward El Salvador, includes Pacaya (visible from Guatemala City), Tecuamburro, Moyuta, and several volcanic fields and dormant cones.\n\nThe volcanic front sits approximately 150–200 km from the Middle America Trench and lies entirely on continental crust exceeding 25 km in thickness. The volcanoes rise from elevations of 1,200–1,600 m on the highland plateau to summit heights of 2,500–4,200 m, with the Pacific coastal plain dropping rapidly to sea level on the southwestern side. This extreme topographic relief concentrates volcanic hazards: pyroclastic flows and lahars channel through steep ravines, gaining speed and destructive power as they descend toward the densely populated lowlands."

    "impact_on_culture_and_economy": {
      "content": "Volcanoes are central to Guatemalan national identity, cultural heritage, and daily life. The colonial city of Antigua Guatemala — a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of Central America's most important tourist destinations — was relocated from Ciudad Vieja after the catastrophic 1541 lahar from Agua, then eventually abandoned as the capital in 1776 after a series of devastating earthquakes (the volcanic setting contributes to the region's intense seismicity). The three volcanoes visible from Antigua — Agua, Fuego, and Acatenango — form one of the most photographed urban-volcanic landscapes in the world.\n\nLake Atitlán, the caldera lake flanked by Atitlán, Tolimán, and San Pedro volcanoes, is Guatemala's most important tourism asset and home to indigenous Maya communities whose cultural traditions predate the Spanish conquest by millennia. Volcanic soils across the highlands support Guatemala's globally significant coffee industry — the country is among the world's top 10 coffee producers — with coffee plants thriving in the mineral-rich andisol soils at elevations of 1,200–2,000 m on volcanic slopes. The economic paradox of Guatemalan volcanism is acute: the same volcanic processes that create fertile soils and stunning landscapes also generate the pyroclastic flows, lahars, and ashfall that kill people, destroy infrastructure, and displace communities."

    "visiting_volcanoes": {
      "content": "Guatemala is one of the premier volcano tourism destinations in the Americas. The most popular experience is the two-day Acatenango hike, which includes overnight camping near the 3,976-m summit to watch Fuego's frequent eruptions illuminate the night sky — an experience rated among the best adventure activities in Central America. Multiple tour operators in Antigua run daily departures during the dry season (November–April).\n\nPacaya offers a shorter day-hike (3–4 hours round trip) from Guatemala City or Antigua, with the possibility of seeing incandescent lava during active periods. The MacKenney crater area and upper lava flows are accessible with local guides. Lake Atitlán provides a scenic base for viewing Atitlán, Tolimán, and San Pedro volcanoes, all of which can be climbed with local guides (San Pedro is the most accessible, approximately 4–5 hours round trip). Tajumulco, the highest point in Central America, requires a strenuous two-day trek from the town of San Marcos.\n\nSafety is a serious consideration. Fuego should not be climbed — it is extremely dangerous and off-limits during active eruption phases. Even on Acatenango, hikers must respect exclusion zones and follow guide instructions regarding Fuego's activity. The dry season (November–April) offers the best conditions; rainy season hiking increases lahar and mudslide risk. Visitors should consult INSIVUMEH and CONRED alerts before any volcano hike."

    "Tajumulco at 4,203 m (13,789 ft) is the highest peak in all of Central America — a dormant stratovolcano in Guatemala's northwestern highlands.",
    "Fuego's June 3, 2018, pyroclastic flow killed at least 190 people and left approximately 234 missing, making it the deadliest volcanic disaster in the Americas in the 21st century.",
    "The 1902 eruption of Santa Maria was a VEI 6 event — one of only four eruptions of that magnitude in the 20th century, alongside Novarupta (1912) and Pinatubo (1991).",
    "Santiaguito, the dome complex growing in Santa Maria's 1902 crater, has been in near-continuous eruption since 1922 — over 100 consecutive years of volcanic activity.",
    "Guatemala's three most iconic volcanoes — Agua, Fuego, and Acatenango — are visible simultaneously from the UNESCO World Heritage city of Antigua Guatemala.",
    "Lake Atitlán occupies a caldera formed by the catastrophic Los Chocoyos eruption approximately 85,000 years ago, which deposited ash as far as Florida and Panama.",
    "Fuego has produced 79 recorded eruptions, more than any other volcano in Central America and among the highest eruption counts for any stratovolcano in the Western Hemisphere.",
    "The original Spanish colonial capital of Guatemala was destroyed in 1541 by a catastrophic lahar from Volcán de Agua, prompting relocation to what is now Antigua Guatemala.",
    "Guatemala is among the world's top 10 coffee-producing nations, with its premium highland coffees grown on the mineral-rich volcanic andisol soils of the Central America Volcanic Arc.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How many volcanoes are in Guatemala?",
      "answer": "Guatemala has 18 Holocene volcanoes cataloged by the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program. All 18 are aligned along the Central America Volcanic Arc, a chain of stratovolcanoes generated by the subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate. The count includes actively erupting volcanoes like Fuego and Santa Maria/Santiaguito, dormant giants like Tajumulco and Agua, and several smaller volcanic fields and domes in the southeastern highlands. Guatemala's volcano count places it 17th globally and 4th in the Americas after the United States, Chile, and Mexico."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the most active volcano in Guatemala?",
      "answer": "Volcán de Fuego is Guatemala's most active volcano, with 79 recorded eruptions — the highest count of any volcano in Central America. Fuego has been in an active eruptive phase since 2002, producing frequent Vulcanian explosions, incandescent avalanches, ashfall, and occasional pyroclastic flows. Its eruptions are often visible from Guatemala City (35 km away) and Antigua Guatemala (16 km). Santa Maria's Santiaguito dome complex is the second most active, having been in near-continuous eruption since 1922, while Pacaya has maintained intermittent activity since 1961."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happened during the 2018 Fuego eruption?",
      "answer": "On June 3, 2018, Volcán de Fuego produced a sustained eruption that generated pyroclastic flows — fast-moving avalanches of superheated gas and volcanic debris — that traveled down ravines on the volcano's southern flank. The flows reached the village of San Miguel Los Lotes, approximately 12 km from the summit, burying homes and residents under several meters of volcanic material. At least 190 people were killed and approximately 234 remain officially missing. The disaster highlighted deficiencies in Guatemala's volcanic early warning systems and evacuation infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the tallest volcano in Guatemala?",
      "answer": "Tajumulco is Guatemala's tallest volcano at 4,203 m (13,789 ft) above sea level — making it not only the highest point in Guatemala but the highest peak in all of Central America. This andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano is located in the northwestern highlands near the Mexican border. Despite its imposing size, Tajumulco has no confirmed historical eruptions and only two Holocene eruptions recognized from geological evidence. The next tallest Guatemalan volcanoes are Acatenango (3,976 m), Fuego (3,799 m), and Agua (3,760 m)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to hike volcanoes in Guatemala?",
      "answer": "Several Guatemalan volcanoes can be safely hiked with appropriate precautions and local guides. Acatenango is the most popular, offering overnight summit camping with views of Fuego's eruptions. Pacaya is a shorter day-hike accessible from Guatemala City or Antigua. San Pedro on Lake Atitlán is also commonly climbed. However, Fuego itself should never be climbed — it is extremely dangerous and off-limits during active phases. Always hire certified local guides, check INSIVUMEH and CONRED volcanic alerts, and hike during the dry season (November–April). Rainy season conditions increase lahar and landslide risk on all volcanic trails."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Santiaguito?",
      "answer": "Santiaguito is a dacitic lava dome complex growing within the 1.5-km-wide crater left by Santa Maria's catastrophic VEI 6 eruption of 1902. The dome began growing in 1922 and has been in near-continuous eruption for over 100 years, making it one of the longest-sustained eruptions on Earth. Santiaguito currently consists of four coalescing dome lobes (Caliente, La Mitad, El Monje, and El Brujo) that produce dome extrusions, block-and-ash flows, and lahars. The active Caliente dome generates periodic explosive events visible from the city of Quetzaltenango (15 km away). Santiaguito is one of the most intensively studied dome-building volcanoes in the world."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Lake Atitlán a volcanic feature?",
      "answer": "Lake Atitlán fills a large caldera formed by the catastrophic Los Chocoyos eruption approximately 85,000 years ago. This eruption — one of the largest known in Central America — ejected over 250 km³ of material as a rhyolitic ignimbrite that deposited ash as far as Florida and Panama. The resulting caldera subsequently filled with water to form the lake, which reaches depths exceeding 340 m. Three post-caldera stratovolcanoes — Atitlán, Tolimán, and San Pedro — were subsequently built along the southern caldera rim, creating the dramatic volcanic landscape that makes Lake Atitlán one of the most scenic locations in the Americas."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often do volcanoes erupt in Guatemala?",
      "answer": "Guatemala experiences volcanic eruptions almost continuously. Fuego produces explosive events on a near-daily to weekly basis during active phases, and Santiaguito has been erupting almost without interruption since 1922. Pacaya maintained sustained activity from 1961 to 2021. Historically, Guatemala has averaged at least one significant eruption per decade at its three most active volcanoes. The country's volcanic arc generates more frequent eruptions than any comparable stretch of the Central America Volcanic Arc, driven by the sustained subduction of the Cocos Plate at approximately 7–8 cm per year."
