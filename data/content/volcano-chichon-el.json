      "content": "El Chichón (also known as El Chichonal) is an active lava dome complex in an isolated part of the Chiapas highlands in southeastern <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-mexico\">Mexico</a>, rising to 1,150 m (3,773 ft). Before its catastrophic eruption in 1982, El Chichón was a heavily forested, little-known volcano — so obscure that it did not appear on most hazard maps. The <a href=\"/volcanic-explosivity-index\">VEI</a> 5 eruption of March–April 1982 changed that dramatically: three major explosive phases over eight days destroyed the summit lava dome, generated devastating pyroclastic flows that killed approximately 2,000 people and obliterated nine villages, and injected an unprecedented volume of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere — more than any eruption since <a href=\"/volcano/krakatau\">Krakatau</a> in 1883. The resulting aerosol cloud caused measurable global cooling of approximately 0.3–0.5°C over 1–2 years. El Chichón sits within the Chiapanecan Volcanic Arc, generated by subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate, but is geographically isolated from Mexico's main Transmexican Volcanic Belt — separated by over 300 km from <a href=\"/volcano/popocatepetl\">Popocatépetl</a> and other well-known Mexican volcanoes. This isolation contributed to its neglect prior to 1982. The eruption created a new 1-km-wide, 300-m-deep crater now containing an acidic lake and active fumaroles."

    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "El Chichón is a trachyandesitic tuff cone and lava dome complex within the Chiapanecan Volcanic Arc, generated by subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate. The arc is separate from and approximately 300 km southeast of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt. The geological history extends back at least 220,000 years, when a major eruption created a 1.6 × 2 km summit crater. A distinguishing chemical feature is the magma's exceptionally high sulfur content — the erupted material contains abundant anhydrite (calcium sulfate), rarely found in volcanic rocks. This explains why the 1982 eruption injected so much SO₂ relative to its size. More than ten large explosive eruptions have occurred since the mid-Holocene, with four reaching VEI 5 — indicating El Chichón, despite modest appearance, is capable of significant explosive magnitude."
    },
    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "El Chichón has produced 13 recorded eruptions since ~6510 BCE, with four reaching VEI 5 — an extraordinarily high proportion for a volcano of its modest size. Major VEI 5 eruptions occurred ~2030 BCE, ~780 CE, ~1360 CE, and 1982 CE, with recurrence intervals of roughly 600–1,200 years. Between paroxysmal events, smaller eruptions and dome-building episodes maintained the complex. The most recent eruption before 1982 was a small event ~1850 CE. The pattern of dome growth alternating with violent explosions is characteristic of lava dome volcanoes worldwide but particularly dangerous at El Chichón due to the magma's high gas and sulfur content."

          "content": "The 1982 eruption began March 28 with a Plinian explosion sending a column ~17 km into the stratosphere. A brief lull was followed by a second explosion on April 3 and a climactic third phase on April 4 generating the most devastating pyroclastic flows and surges. These swept down the flanks at speeds exceeding 100 km/h, destroying nine Zoque indigenous villages within 8 km. The village of Francisco León was buried under meters of deposits, killing virtually all ~1,000 residents who hadn't evacuated. Total fatalities are estimated at ~2,000. The eruption destroyed the summit dome and created a 1-km-wide, 300-m-deep crater. Its most globally significant impact was atmospheric: the high-sulfur magma released 7–10 megatons of SO₂ into the stratosphere, forming a sulfuric acid aerosol cloud that encircled the globe within three weeks and persisted over a year. The resulting aerosol loading was the highest since at least <a href=\"/volcano/krakatau\">Krakatau</a> in 1883, causing global temperatures to decrease ~0.3–0.5°C. The eruption exposed critical gaps in Mexico's volcanic monitoring, particularly for remote indigenous communities, and contributed to the creation of CENAPRED in 1988."

      "content": "Since 1982, El Chichón's new crater has filled with an acidic lake with temperatures up to 52°C and pH as low as 1.7. Active fumaroles emit sulfurous gases at temperatures exceeding 100°C. The volcano is monitored by CENAPRED and UNAM with seismometers, tiltmeters, and geochemical sampling. Monitoring has detected periodic increases in seismicity and gas flux, but no eruption has occurred since 1982. The combination of high-sulfur magma, demonstrated VEI 5 capability, and a surrounding population that has partially reoccupied the danger zone makes El Chichón a high-priority monitoring target."

    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "Primary hazards include pyroclastic flows and surges (which devastated 8 km radius in 1982), tephra fall, lahars (a major concern given heavy tropical rainfall mobilizing loose deposits for years), and volcanic gas emissions. The acidic crater lake poses a lahar hazard if displaced by eruption. ~40,000–50,000 people live within 15 km, many in Zoque communities with limited infrastructure. Following 1982, some villages were relocated, but population growth has increased exposure levels. CENAPRED has developed hazard maps, but the remote terrain and limited road access complicate emergency response."

    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "El Chichón occupies an isolated position in the northern Chiapas highlands, surrounded by tropical forest. Prior to 1982, the summit stood at ~1,260 m, but the eruption reduced it to 1,150 m and replaced the dome with a 1-km-wide, 300-m-deep crater. The complex includes three craters: the main summit crater (now with acidic lake), a SW crater filled by a lava dome, and a SE crater. The surrounding landscape has been profoundly altered — dense tropical forest replaced by scarred terrain slowly revegetating over four decades."
    },
    "climate_and_global_impact": {
      "content": "The 1982 eruption had a disproportionately large climate impact because of the magma's exceptional sulfur content. The 7–10 megatons of SO₂ injected was comparable to the much larger 1991 eruption of <a href=\"/volcano/pinatubo\">Pinatubo</a> despite producing far less tephra. The aerosol cloud encircled the globe in three weeks, reflecting solar radiation and causing ~0.3–0.5°C cooling over 1–2 years. Spectacular sunsets were observed worldwide. The eruption established the importance of volcanic sulfur (not just tephra volume) in controlling climatic effects — a scientific insight reinforced by the 1991 Pinatubo eruption."
    },
    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "The 1982 eruption devastated the homeland of the Zoque people, one of Mexico's most ancient indigenous groups with cultural roots stretching to the Olmec civilization. Nine villages were destroyed and survivors displaced to resettlement camps. The disaster exposed the vulnerability of marginalized indigenous communities and contributed to the creation of CENAPRED in 1988. For the Zoque, the eruption remains a defining cultural trauma. The name 'chichón' in local Spanish means 'bump' or 'lump,' reflecting the volcano's modest, dome-like pre-1982 appearance."
    },
    "visiting_and_tourism": {
      "content": "El Chichón is not a major tourist destination due to its remote location in the Chiapas highlands. Access is via unpaved roads from Pichucalco (~25 km north). The crater and acidic lake can be reached by a challenging full-day hike from Chapultenango with a local guide. The barren pyroclastic flow deposits slowly being reclaimed by tropical vegetation offer a stark view of volcanic devastation. The crater lake, steaming fumaroles, and sheer crater walls provide a dramatic volcanological experience for dedicated visitors."

    "nearby_volcanoes": {
      "content": "El Chichón is the most recently active volcano in the Chiapanecan Volcanic Arc, geographically isolated from Mexico's Transmexican Volcanic Belt — home to <a href=\"/volcano/popocatepetl\">Popocatépetl</a> and <a href=\"/volcano/colima\">Volcán de Colima</a>, over 300 km to the northwest. To the southeast, Guatemala's volcanoes — including <a href=\"/volcano/fuego\">Fuego</a> — continue the Central American arc. El Chichón's isolated position underscores the importance of monitoring all volcanic systems, not just prominent ones."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "When did El Chichón erupt?",
      "answer": "El Chichón's most recent and most devastating eruption occurred from March 28 to April 4, 1982, in three major explosive phases. The eruption destroyed the summit lava dome, killed approximately 2,000 people, and injected massive quantities of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, causing measurable global cooling. The volcano has produced 13 known eruptions since ~6510 BCE, with four reaching VEI 5. The recurrence interval for major eruptions is approximately 600–1,200 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many people died in the 1982 El Chichón eruption?",
      "answer": "Approximately 2,000 people died in the 1982 eruption, making it the deadliest volcanic event in modern Mexican history. Most fatalities occurred in nine Zoque indigenous villages within 8 km of the volcano, destroyed by pyroclastic flows and surges on April 3–4. The village of Francisco León lost virtually all ~1,000 residents who had not evacuated. Precise figures are uncertain because of the remote, indigenous character of the affected communities and limited pre-eruption census data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is El Chichón still active?",
      "answer": "Yes, El Chichón is classified as an active volcano. Although it has not erupted since 1982, the crater formed by that eruption hosts an acidic lake (pH as low as 1.7, temperature up to 52°C) and active fumaroles emitting sulfurous gases at temperatures exceeding 100°C. These features confirm ongoing magmatic and hydrothermal activity beneath the volcano. Periodic seismic swarms and gas flux increases are detected by monitoring instruments. With four VEI 5 eruptions in 4,000 years, future eruptions are considered likely."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did El Chichón affect global climate?",
      "answer": "El Chichón's 1982 eruption injected 7–10 megatons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere — an enormous quantity for a VEI 5 eruption, comparable to the much larger 1991 Pinatubo eruption. The SO₂ converted to sulfuric acid aerosols that encircled the globe within three weeks, reflecting sunlight and reducing global average temperatures by approximately 0.3–0.5°C for 1–2 years. The eruption established the scientific principle that volcanic sulfur content, not erupted volume alone, determines climate impact."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of volcano is El Chichón?",
      "answer": "El Chichón is a lava dome complex — a type of volcano built by the extrusion of viscous, gas-rich magma that piles up around the vent rather than flowing far downhill. Lava dome volcanoes are typically small but can produce devastatingly explosive eruptions when pressurized gas escapes catastrophically. El Chichón's trachyandesitic magma is unusually rich in sulfur (containing anhydrite), which made the 1982 eruption disproportionately impactful on global climate despite the volcano's modest size."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where is El Chichón located?",
      "answer": "El Chichón is located in the Francisco León municipality of Chiapas state in southeastern Mexico, at approximately 17.36°N, 93.23°W. It sits within the Chiapanecan Volcanic Arc, a chain of volcanic centers geographically isolated from Mexico's main Transmexican Volcanic Belt by over 300 km. The nearest town is Pichucalco, approximately 25 km to the north. The regional capital Villahermosa (Tabasco) is about 80 km north."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could El Chichón erupt again?",
      "answer": "Yes, future eruptions at El Chichón are considered likely. The volcano has produced four VEI 5 eruptions in the past ~4,000 years, with a rough recurrence interval of 600–1,200 years. The current repose period since 1982 is short by historical standards. Active fumaroles, an acidic crater lake, and periodic seismic increases confirm the magmatic system remains active. ~40,000–50,000 people now live within 15 km, and CENAPRED maintains monitoring and hazard plans."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was the 1982 eruption so deadly?",
      "answer": "The 1982 eruption was devastating because El Chichón was virtually unknown as a volcanic hazard. The volcano did not appear on most hazard maps, no monitoring was in place, and no evacuation plans existed for the surrounding Zoque indigenous villages. When pyroclastic flows swept down the flanks on April 3–4 at speeds exceeding 100 km/h, communities within 8 km had received inadequate warning. The remoteness of the Chiapas highlands, limited road access, and the political marginalization of indigenous communities all compounded the disaster. The event led to major reforms in Mexico's disaster preparedness."
