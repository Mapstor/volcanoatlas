      "content": "Agua de Pau is an active <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> dominating the center of São Miguel Island in the <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-portugal\">Azores</a> archipelago, rising to 947 m (3,107 ft) — the highest point on the island. It is defined by a remarkable double caldera system: an outer 4 × 7 km caldera formed between 30,000 and 45,000 years ago, and a younger inner 2.5 × 3 km caldera created approximately 15,000 years ago. The inner caldera hosts Lagoa do Fogo (Lake of Fire), one of the most pristine volcanic crater lakes in Europe. With two confirmed <a href=\"/volcanic-explosivity-index\">VEI 5</a> eruptions — the Fogo-A Plinian event around 2990 BCE and the devastating 1563 eruption — Agua de Pau is the most explosively powerful of São Miguel's three active volcanic centers. The 1563 eruption was one of the largest in the Azores' recorded history, producing a Plinian column, extensive trachytic pumice falls, and pyroclastic flows that caused significant destruction on the central isthmus of São Miguel. Flanked by <a href=\"/volcano/sete-cidades\">Sete Cidades</a> to the west and <a href=\"/volcano/furnas\">Furnas</a> to the east, Agua de Pau occupies the narrowest part of São Miguel, where the island pinches to just 8 km across — a geography that places substantial populations on both the north and south coasts within the volcano's hazard zone."
    },
    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Agua de Pau's geological history spans at least 100,000 years of eruptive activity along the Terceira Rift, the tectonic spreading zone that generates volcanism across the Azores. The double caldera structure records two major collapse episodes. The older outer caldera (4 × 7 km) formed between 30,000 and 45,000 years ago during a massive eruption that excavated the summit. The younger inner caldera (2.5 × 3 km) was created approximately 15,000 years ago and now partially fills with the waters of Lagoa do Fogo. After the younger caldera formed, volcanic activity did not resume within it for roughly 10,000 years. Around 5,000 years ago, activity restarted with the massive Fogo-A eruption, which deposited approximately 3 km³ of trachytic pumice — one of the largest Holocene eruptions in the Azores. Post-caldera lava domes were emplaced on the northern and western flanks, and numerous flank cinder cones mark radial and concentric fissures. Like <a href=\"/volcano/sete-cidades\">Sete Cidades</a>, Agua de Pau erupts primarily trachytic to trachydacitic magma, compositions that favor explosive behavior due to their higher silica content and gas retention."
    },
    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "Agua de Pau has produced 10 documented eruptions spanning roughly 8,750 years, though the true total is almost certainly higher given the volcano's age. The eruption record divides naturally into two phases: an early period of flank and dome-building eruptions (6750 BCE to roughly 2210 BCE), and a later phase of major caldera and flank explosive events. The Fogo-A eruption around 2990 BCE was a pivotal moment — a VEI 5 Plinian event that produced ~3 km³ of pumice fallout and marks the resumption of activity within the inner caldera after a long dormancy. Subsequent eruptions at roughly 500–800 year intervals include VEI 3 and VEI 4 events, culminating in the devastating 1563 eruption. The historical record consists of only two events: the 1563 VEI 5 eruption and a smaller VEI 2 follow-up in 1564. The 460+ years since 1564 represent the longest documented repose at Agua de Pau, and hydrothermal activity (hot springs on the northwest flank) confirms that the magmatic system remains active."

          "title": "The Fogo-A Eruption (~2990 BCE) — The Caldera Reawakens",
          "content": "Approximately 5,000 years ago, Agua de Pau erupted in a massive VEI 5 Plinian event known as the Fogo-A eruption. This event deposited roughly 3 km³ of trachytic pumice across central and eastern São Miguel, making it one of the largest Holocene volcanic events in the Azores and among the most powerful eruptions in the mid-Atlantic during the past 10,000 years. The Fogo-A deposit is a critical stratigraphic marker used by geologists throughout the island to date other volcanic and sedimentary sequences. The eruption marked the resumption of activity within the inner caldera after approximately 10,000 years of quiescence — a reminder that very long dormancy periods do not signify extinction."

          "title": "The 1563 Eruption — São Miguel's Worst Volcanic Disaster",
          "content": "The 1563 eruption was the most destructive volcanic event in São Miguel's recorded history. It began in late June 1563 with a VEI 5 Plinian explosive phase from the caldera, generating a towering eruption column and depositing thick trachytic pumice falls across central São Miguel. Pyroclastic flows swept down the flanks, and the eruption was accompanied by vigorous activity at Cerro Queimado (Burnt Hill) on the northwest flank, where a lava dome was extruded. Contemporary Portuguese accounts describe devastating ashfall on the towns of Ribeira Grande (north coast) and Vila Franca do Campo (south coast), destruction of agricultural land, and casualties — though precise death tolls are uncertain. The eruption produced one of the thickest and most widespread pumice deposits in the Azorean geological record. A smaller VEI 2 eruption followed in 1564, likely from residual activity within the caldera at Lagoa do Fogo. Together, the 1563–1564 events demonstrated Agua de Pau's capacity for catastrophic Plinian eruptions."

    "current_status_and_monitoring": {
      "content": "Agua de Pau has been in repose since 1564 — over 460 years — the longest dormancy in its documented record. Despite this, the volcano is unambiguously active. Prominent hot springs on the northwest flank, including those at Caldeira Velha, discharge geothermally heated water at temperatures exceeding 90°C, confirming ongoing magmatic heat input. CIVISA maintains seismic and geodetic monitoring stations around the volcano, and diffuse CO₂ degassing is measured regularly. Low-magnitude seismic swarms are occasionally detected beneath the edifice. The long repose is actually consistent with Agua de Pau's eruption frequency — its 10 known eruptions over ~8,750 years suggest an average recurrence of roughly 875 years, though the two VEI 5 events occurred approximately 4,500 years apart. Scientists consider a future eruption certain on geological timescales, with the key uncertainty being when and at what scale."
    },
    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "Agua de Pau is arguably the most hazardous volcano in the Azores due to its demonstrated capacity for VEI 5 Plinian eruptions and its position on São Miguel's narrowest isthmus. The primary hazards include Plinian pumice falls (capable of depositing meters of tephra across the central island), pyroclastic density currents channeled down valleys toward both the north and south coasts, and lahars generated by the interaction of hot erupted material with Lagoa do Fogo's lake water. Approximately 30,000 people live on the central isthmus, with the towns of Ribeira Grande (north) and Vila Franca do Campo (south) directly exposed. Both communities were severely impacted in 1563 and would face similar or greater risks today given increased population density. A Plinian eruption would disrupt air traffic across the entire eastern Atlantic and could deposit ash on the Azores' main international airport at Ponta Delgada."
    },
    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "Agua de Pau forms a broad volcanic massif across São Miguel's central section, where the island narrows to just 8 km from coast to coast. The double caldera is the dominant topographic feature: the outer caldera's steep, forested walls frame the inner caldera containing Lagoa do Fogo, a lake roughly 1.4 km long and 500 m wide. The lake sits at approximately 575 m elevation and is surrounded by near-vertical inner caldera walls rising 200–300 m above the water. Dense native vegetation, including remnants of the Azorean laurel forest (Laurissilva), cloaks the caldera interior, making Lagoa do Fogo one of the most ecologically intact volcanic landscapes in Macaronesia. Outside the caldera, the flanks are dissected by deeply incised valleys (ribeiras) and dotted with parasitic cinder cones and lava domes. The northwest flank features the Caldeira Velha hot springs, a popular geothermal swimming site set in a lush tropical-feeling forest."
    },
    "visiting_and_tourism": {
      "content": "Lagoa do Fogo is one of São Miguel's premier natural attractions, accessible via a well-maintained trail descending from the EN5-2A road on the caldera rim (approximately 45 minutes downhill to the lakeshore, moderate difficulty). The lake's white sandy beach, emerald water, and towering caldera walls create a dramatic, almost primeval atmosphere. Swimming is permitted but the water is cold year-round. The Caldeira Velha natural hot springs, a short drive to the northwest, offer warm geothermal pools in a ferny forest setting (admission charged). The caldera rim road provides multiple scenic viewpoints. The area falls within the Lagoa do Fogo Natural Reserve, and visitors should stay on marked trails to protect the fragile endemic vegetation."

    "nearby_volcanoes": {
      "content": "Agua de Pau is the middle member of São Miguel's three-volcano alignment. To the west lies <a href=\"/volcano/sete-cidades\">Sete Cidades</a> (842 m), whose twin-lake caldera is the island's most iconic image. To the east, <a href=\"/volcano/furnas\">Furnas</a> (805 m) is famous for its active hydrothermal area and the 1630 VEI 5 eruption. Between Sete Cidades and Agua de Pau, the Picos Fissure Zone features basaltic cinder cones and lava fields. All three volcanoes sit on the Terceira Rift and share the same tectonic driver. São Miguel is one of only a handful of islands worldwide with three independently active polygenetic volcanoes in such close proximity."
    },
    "etymology": {
      "content": "The name 'Agua de Pau' (Portuguese for 'Water of Pau' or 'Water from the stick/tree') is believed to reference the abundant freshwater springs that issue from the volcano's heavily vegetated flanks, which historically supplied surrounding communities. The caldera lake's name — Lagoa do Fogo, 'Lake of Fire' — evokes the volcano's fiery origins, though the serene turquoise waters visible today belie the explosive violence that created them."
