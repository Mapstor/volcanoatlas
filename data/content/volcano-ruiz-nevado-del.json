      "content": "Nevado del Ruiz is an active <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> rising to 5,279 m (17,319 ft) in the Central Cordillera of the Colombian Andes, straddling the border of the Caldas and Tolima departments approximately 130 km (81 mi) west of Bogotá. It is the northernmost glacier-capped volcano in South America and one of the most hazardous volcanoes on the continent, owing to a lethal combination of summit ice, steep drainages, and densely populated river valleys below. The volcano is globally notorious for the catastrophic eruption of November 13, 1985, when a relatively modest VEI 3 eruption melted glacial ice and triggered lahars (volcanic mudflows) that raced down river channels at speeds exceeding 60 km/h, obliterating the town of Armero 74 km downstream and killing approximately 23,000 people — ranking it among the <a href=\"/deadliest-eruptions\">deadliest volcanic disasters in history</a>. Nevado del Ruiz sits above the subduction zone where the Nazca Plate dives beneath the South American Plate, the same tectonic engine that drives <a href=\"/volcano/cotopaxi\">Cotopaxi</a>, <a href=\"/volcano/tungurahua\">Tungurahua</a>, and <a href=\"/volcano/galeras\">Galeras</a>. The volcano has been in a state of renewed unrest since 2012, with intermittent ash emissions and elevated seismicity at the summit Arenas Crater, a reminder that the danger never truly subsides. Its broad, glacier-covered massif, spanning more than 200 km², makes it a dominant landmark visible from Manizales, Armenia, and Pereira — three cities in <a href=\"/volcanoes-in-colombia\">Colombia's</a> coffee-growing heartland that together house over 1.5 million people."
    },
    "geology_and_formation": {
      "content": "Nevado del Ruiz belongs to the Northern Andean Volcanic Arc, generated by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate beneath the thick continental crust of the South American Plate at a rate of roughly 58 mm per year. The volcanic complex has been built over the course of approximately two million years, through three major edifice-building stages. The ancestral Ruiz volcano formed during the early Pleistocene, constructing a broad andesitic to dacitic shield. A second phase produced the Older Ruiz edifice, which was subsequently destroyed by massive sector collapses — the headwall scars of these enormous landslides remain visible on the volcano's flanks today. The modern cone, known as the Present Ruiz, consists of a cluster of lava domes built within the caldera remnants of the older structure. The summit is crowned by the Arenas Crater, a 1-km-wide, 240-m-deep pit that has been the focus of all historical eruptive activity. On the southwestern flank, the prominent La Olleta pyroclastic cone represents a secondary vent that may have also been active in historical times. The magma feeding Nevado del Ruiz is predominantly andesitic and basaltic andesite, typical of subduction-zone volcanism — viscous enough to produce explosive eruptions but not as silica-rich as the dacitic magmas of some neighboring volcanoes. This composition, combined with the thick continental crust through which the magma ascends, produces moderate-intensity explosive activity that is deadly not so much for its pyroclastic power as for its ability to rapidly melt the volcano's ~10 km² ice cap. The interaction of hot volcanic material with glacial ice is the defining hazard of this <a href=\"/types-of-volcanoes\">stratovolcano</a> — even a relatively small eruption can generate catastrophic lahars that travel tens of kilometers downstream."
    },
    "eruption_history_overview": {
      "content": "The Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program records 24 eruptions at Nevado del Ruiz, spanning from approximately 6660 BCE to the ongoing activity that began in 2014. The eruption record reveals a volcano capable of both prolonged low-level unrest and devastating paroxysmal events. At least four eruptions have reached <a href=\"/volcanic-explosivity-index\">VEI 4</a> (~850 BCE, ~200 BCE, ~1350 CE, and 1595 CE), each likely producing significant lahars given the persistent glacial cover. Historical eruptions since the 16th century have occurred at intervals ranging from a few years to nearly a century, with a conspicuous cluster of activity in the 1820s–1840s and another in the 1980s–present. The defining pattern at Nevado del Ruiz is not massive explosive eruptions — its largest events are modest by global standards — but rather the catastrophic secondary effects of even moderate eruptions interacting with glacial ice and funneling lahars into narrow river valleys toward populated lowlands."

          "title": "The 1985 Eruption and Armero Tragedy — South America's Deadliest Eruption",
          "content": "On the evening of November 13, 1985, Nevado del Ruiz erupted in a VEI 3 event that, by purely volcanic measures, was relatively unremarkable — yet it produced one of the worst volcanic disasters of the 20th century. The eruption had been preceded by over a year of warning signs. From December 1984, the volcano exhibited increased fumarolic activity, small phreatic explosions, and sulfur dioxide emissions from the Arenas Crater. Scientists from the Colombian Geological Survey and visiting international volcanologists warned repeatedly that an eruption could melt glacial ice and generate deadly lahars. A hazard map published in October 1985 accurately depicted lahar inundation zones, including the town of Armero. Despite these warnings, political indecision, inadequate communication infrastructure, and a lack of public awareness led to a failure to evacuate. At approximately 9:09 PM on November 13, a brief but intense explosive eruption sent pyroclastic density currents surging across the summit ice cap. The hot volcanic material melted roughly 10% of the glacier, and the resulting meltwater mixed with volcanic debris to form lahars in all major river drainages. The largest lahar descended the Lagunillas River valley, growing in volume as it entrained sediment and water. By the time it reached Armero — a prosperous agricultural town of approximately 29,000 inhabitants located 74 km from the summit at an elevation of just 370 m — the lahar was a wall of mud, boulders, and debris 2–5 m deep moving at roughly 60 km/h (37 mph). It struck at approximately 11:30 PM, while most residents were sleeping. Roughly three-quarters of the town was buried within minutes. An estimated 23,000 people died, along with 5,000 injured and 5,000 homes destroyed. Another lahar traveling down the Chinchiná River killed approximately 1,000 people in the town of Chinchiná. The Armero tragedy became a defining case study in volcanology and disaster management, demonstrating that a scientifically well-understood hazard, predicted weeks in advance, could still claim tens of thousands of lives when institutional and communication failures prevent evacuation. The iconic photograph of 13-year-old Omayra Sánchez, trapped in debris for three days before dying, became one of the most powerful images of natural disaster in the 20th century and galvanized reform of volcanic hazard management worldwide."

Spanish colonial accounts describe enormous mudflows descending the Lagunillas and Gualí river valleys, blocking waterways and destroying settlements along the rivers. The 1595 lahars deposited material across the same floodplain where Armero would later be built — a grim historical precedent that was either unknown to or disregarded by the town's inhabitants and civic authorities nearly four centuries later. Estimates suggest 636 people died, a smaller toll reflecting the sparse colonial-era population of the region. The eruption confirmed that glacier–volcano interaction is a recurring and fundamental hazard at Nevado del Ruiz."

This eruption further deposited material on the Armero floodplain, and the lahar deposits from 1595 and 1845 literally formed the substrate on which Armero was subsequently rebuilt and expanded. The 1845 event demonstrated the volcano's capacity to produce lethal lahars even during moderate eruptions, a pattern that would be tragically repeated 140 years later."

Since November 2014, the volcano has been in a state of ongoing low-level eruption (VEI 2), with intermittent ash emissions, elevated seismicity, sulfur dioxide outgassing, and periodic closure of nearby airports. The Colombian Geological Survey maintains the volcano at a heightened alert level and has extensively upgraded monitoring networks and early warning systems — a direct legacy of the 1985 disaster. The current unrest is a reminder that Nevado del Ruiz remains very much an active and potentially dangerous volcano."

    "current_status_and_monitoring": {
      "content": "Nevado del Ruiz has been in a state of elevated unrest since 2010, with the most recent confirmed eruption beginning in November 2014 and continuing as of 2025. The Servicio Geológico Colombiano (SGC) operates the Manizales Volcano Observatory, which maintains an extensive monitoring network including seismometers, tiltmeters, GPS receivers, gas-measuring stations (SO₂ and CO₂ flux), infrasound sensors, and webcams focused on the Arenas Crater. In 2023 and 2024, the volcano repeatedly triggered elevated alert levels (Orange — Level III) due to increases in seismic energy, ash emissions visible on satellite imagery, and thermal anomalies detected at the summit. The SGC regularly publishes bulletins and has invested heavily in lahar early warning systems in downstream river valleys, including sirens, automated gauges, and community evacuation drills in towns like Villamaría, Chinchiná, and the rebuilt communities near former Armero. Scientists assess that the current glacial retreat — from approximately 25 km² in 1985 to roughly 10 km² today — reduces but does not eliminate the lahar hazard; even the remaining ice volume is sufficient to produce devastating mudflows in the event of a moderate eruption."
    },
    "hazards_and_risk_assessment": {
      "content": "The primary hazard at Nevado del Ruiz is not pyroclastic flows or lava but lahars — volcanic mudflows generated when hot eruption products interact with the summit glacier and snowfields. The 1985 disaster proved that even a moderate VEI 3 eruption can produce lahars capable of traveling over 100 km from the summit and burying entire towns. The volcano's six major river drainages — the Lagunillas, Azufrado, Gualí, Molinos, Nereidas, and Chinchiná — channel lahars directly toward populated lowlands. Approximately 500,000 people live in areas potentially affected by lahars from Nevado del Ruiz, including residents of Manizales (population ~400,000), Chinchiná, Villamaría, and smaller communities. Beyond lahars, the volcano poses threats from ashfall (which can disrupt aviation and agriculture across a wide area), pyroclastic density currents (confined to the upper flanks), and lateral blasts. The Arenas Crater's position atop a rapidly shrinking glacier introduces an evolving hazard landscape — as ice retreats, lahar volumes may decrease for moderate eruptions, but the exposed crater walls become more susceptible to collapse, and the overall volcanic hazard remains high. Colombian authorities maintain detailed hazard maps and evacuation plans, with community preparedness programs that are among the most advanced in Latin America — a direct institutional legacy of the Armero tragedy."

    "geography_and_physical_description": {
      "content": "Nevado del Ruiz is an immense volcanic massif covering more than 200 km² in the Central Cordillera of the Colombian Andes, situated within Los Nevados National Natural Park. The summit stands at 5,279 m (17,319 ft), making it one of the highest active volcanoes outside of the Altiplano. The volcano's broad, gently sloping profile belies its explosive potential — its flanks are deeply incised by glacially carved valleys and scarred by the headwalls of massive prehistoric landslides. The summit is crowned by the Arenas Crater, a roughly circular pit 1 km in diameter and 240 m deep, perpetually steaming with fumarolic gases. A diminishing ice cap — once over 25 km² and now approximately 10 km² — covers the upper reaches, feeding glacial meltwater into six principal river systems that drain in all directions. The La Olleta pyroclastic cone, located on the southwestern flank at approximately 4,850 m, represents a secondary vent that adds to the complexity of potential eruption scenarios. On clear days, the snow-capped summit is visible from Manizales, Pereira, and Armenia — the three major cities of Colombia's Eje Cafetero (Coffee Axis) — towering above the lush green slopes of one of the world's most productive coffee-growing regions."
    },
    "climate_and_global_impact": {
      "content": "Nevado del Ruiz's eruptions have been predominantly regional in impact rather than global. The 1985 eruption, at VEI 3, injected only modest quantities of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere and did not produce measurable global cooling — its devastation was entirely due to secondary lahar effects rather than atmospheric perturbation. The historical VEI 4 eruptions of 1595 and ~1350 CE may have produced detectable regional ashfall but are not associated with significant climate forcing. However, the volcano's glaciers serve as sensitive climate indicators: the dramatic retreat from approximately 25 km² to 10 km² between 1985 and 2025 reflects both volcanic heating from below and anthropogenic climate warming. Scientists project that the Nevado del Ruiz ice cap could disappear entirely by mid-century, fundamentally altering both the volcano's hazard profile and its role as a water source for downstream communities. For comparison, truly climate-altering eruptions like <a href=\"/volcano/tambora\">Tambora</a> (1815, VEI 7) or <a href=\"/volcano/pinatubo\">Pinatubo</a> (1991, VEI 6) ejected far larger volumes of sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere."

    "cultural_significance": {
      "content": "Nevado del Ruiz is deeply woven into Colombian national consciousness. The indigenous Quimbaya people called it Kumanday (loosely 'White Grandeur'), and it has featured in Andean mythology as a sacred peak for millennia. For modern Colombians, the volcano is inseparable from the Armero tragedy of 1985, which remains the country's deadliest natural disaster and a collective wound in national memory. The disaster transformed Colombia's approach to geological hazard management and contributed to the creation of more robust international early warning protocols. The photograph of Omayra Sánchez, the 13-year-old girl trapped in lahar debris whose death was documented by photographer Frank Fournier, won the 1986 World Press Photo of the Year and became an enduring symbol of both natural disaster and institutional failure. Today, a memorial park marks the site of Armero, and November 13 is commemorated annually. The volcano also holds cultural significance as the centerpiece of Los Nevados National Natural Park, a popular trekking and mountaineering destination, and as the snowcapped backdrop to Colombia's celebrated coffee region — a UNESCO Cultural Landscape."

    "visiting_and_tourism": {
      "content": "Nevado del Ruiz lies within Los Nevados National Natural Park, one of Colombia's most visited highland protected areas. Access is typically from Manizales (25 km west), with the park entrance at approximately 4,150 m elevation reachable by 4x4 vehicle. However, summit access is heavily restricted due to ongoing volcanic activity — since 2012, authorities have periodically closed the upper mountain to climbers and trekkers when alert levels are elevated. When open, the standard summit approach follows the traditional route via the Arenas Crater rim, requiring mountaineering equipment and glacier travel skills. Lower-altitude trails within Los Nevados offer spectacular páramo (high-altitude moorland) landscapes, hot springs at Termales del Ruiz, and views of the neighbouring peaks of Nevado del Tolima and Nevado de Santa Isabel. The best visiting season is December–February and June–August, during Colombia's drier periods. All visitors must check current volcanic alert levels with the SGC before planning any trip to the upper mountain. The nearby cities of Manizales, Pereira, and Armenia offer excellent infrastructure as bases for exploring the coffee region and the park."

The neighbouring Nevado del Tolima (5,200 m), just 35 km to the south, is another glacier-bearing stratovolcano within Los Nevados National Natural Park. <a href=\"/volcano/galeras\">Galeras</a> (4,276 m), located 300 km to the southwest near the city of Pasto, is Colombia's other historically active major volcano, with 42 recorded eruptions. The Machín volcano, a lava-dome complex 150 km south of Ruiz, is considered a significant but undermonitored threat due to its proximity to Ibagué (population 530,000). Across the broader Northern Andean Volcanic Arc, Nevado del Ruiz shares its subduction-driven tectonic engine with <a href=\"/volcano/cotopaxi\">Cotopaxi</a> and <a href=\"/volcano/tungurahua\">Tungurahua</a> in Ecuador and the extinct Chimborazo."
    },
    "etymology": {
      "content": "The name Nevado del Ruiz combines the Spanish 'nevado' (snow-covered) with 'Ruiz,' believed to derive from an early Spanish colonial landowner or explorer of the region. The indigenous Quimbaya name Kumanday is sometimes translated as 'White Grandeur' or 'White Summit,' reflecting the volcano's perpetual ice cap visible across the Andes. The volcano is also colloquially known as 'the Sleeping Lion' (El León Dormido) among local Colombians, a nickname that took on dark irony after the 1985 disaster."

    "The 1985 Armero lahar traveled 74 km from the summit at speeds exceeding 60 km/h, burying three-quarters of the town in just minutes.",
    "Nevado del Ruiz's 1985 eruption was only VEI 3 — a moderate event — yet it killed approximately 23,000 people, making it the fourth-deadliest volcanic disaster since 1500 CE.",
    "The volcano's ice cap has shrunk from approximately 25 km² in 1985 to roughly 10 km² in 2025, losing 60% of its glacial cover in just 40 years.",
    "Armero was built directly on lahar deposits from the 1595 and 1845 eruptions — the historical record of the hazard was literally beneath the town's foundations.",
    "Nevado del Ruiz is the northernmost glacier-bearing volcano in South America and one of only a handful of equatorial peaks with permanent ice.",
    "The Arenas Crater at the summit is 1 km wide and 240 m deep — large enough to fit approximately 200 football fields inside.",
    "A hazard map published in October 1985, just weeks before the disaster, correctly showed Armero within the lahar inundation zone, but evacuation orders were never effectively issued.",
    "The photograph of Omayra Sánchez, a 13-year-old trapped in Armero's debris for 60 hours before dying, won the 1986 World Press Photo of the Year.",
    "Colombia's volcano monitoring system was completely rebuilt after 1985, and the country now operates one of the most advanced lahar early warning networks in Latin America.",
    "At 5,279 m, Nevado del Ruiz stands higher than Mont Blanc (4,808 m) and any peak in the contiguous United States.",
    "The volcano lies at the heart of Colombia's Eje Cafetero (Coffee Axis), a UNESCO Cultural Landscape — its fertile volcanic soils produce some of the world's finest coffee.",
    "Between 1826 and 1833, Nevado del Ruiz erupted at least five times in rapid succession, an unusually active cluster that included four VEI 2 events."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Nevado del Ruiz still active?",
      "answer": "Yes, Nevado del Ruiz is an active stratovolcano that has been in a state of ongoing eruptive unrest since 2012. The Arenas Crater regularly emits ash plumes, volcanic gases (particularly sulfur dioxide), and generates volcanic earthquakes. The Colombian Geological Survey (SGC) continuously monitors the volcano with seismometers, GPS stations, gas sensors, and webcams. The volcano has been at elevated alert levels (Orange/Level III) multiple times in recent years. Volcanologists consider another significant eruption not a matter of if, but when."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happened in the 1985 Nevado del Ruiz disaster?",
      "answer": "On November 13, 1985, a VEI 3 eruption melted approximately 10% of the summit glacier, generating massive lahars (volcanic mudflows) that traveled up to 100 km down river valleys. The largest lahar descended the Lagunillas River and struck the town of Armero at approximately 11:30 PM, burying three-quarters of the town under 2–5 m of mud and debris. Approximately 23,000 people died, 5,000 were injured, and 5,000 homes were destroyed. It was the deadliest lahar event in recorded history and South America's worst volcanic disaster."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could Nevado del Ruiz erupt again?",
      "answer": "Yes, Nevado del Ruiz will almost certainly erupt again — it has been in a state of continuous low-level eruption since 2014. The volcano has produced 24 eruptions over the past 8,600 years, with at least four reaching VEI 4. While the shrinking glacier reduces the potential lahar volume somewhat, even the remaining ~10 km² of ice is sufficient to produce devastating mudflows. The SGC maintains detailed hazard maps and lahar early warning systems. The key difference from 1985 is that extensive monitoring and evacuation infrastructure is now in place."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall is Nevado del Ruiz?",
      "answer": "Nevado del Ruiz stands 5,279 m (17,319 ft) above sea level, making it the northernmost glacier-capped volcano in South America. It is taller than Mont Blanc (4,808 m), the highest peak in the Alps, and taller than any mountain in the contiguous United States. The volcano's massive edifice covers more than 200 km², and its summit is capped by a diminishing ice field of approximately 10 km². The Arenas Crater at the summit sits at roughly 5,279 m with walls descending 240 m to the crater floor."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many people died in the Armero tragedy?",
      "answer": "Approximately 23,000 people died when lahars from the November 13, 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz destroyed the town of Armero. An additional ~1,000 people were killed in Chinchiná by a separate lahar traveling down the Chinchiná River. Armero had a population of approximately 29,000, meaning roughly 75–80% of the town's inhabitants perished. The disaster also injured 5,000 people and destroyed 5,000 homes. It ranks as the deadliest lahar event in recorded history and the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, after the 1902 eruption of Mont Pelée."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of volcano is Nevado del Ruiz?",
      "answer": "Nevado del Ruiz is a stratovolcano (composite volcano) built from alternating layers of andesitic lava flows, pyroclastic deposits, and volcanic debris. It was constructed over approximately two million years across three major building phases, with the modern cone occupying the caldera of an older collapsed edifice. The volcano is powered by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate. Its predominantly andesitic magma produces moderate explosive eruptions — typically VEI 2–4 — that are dangerous primarily because hot eruptive material melts the summit glacier, generating lethal lahars."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you visit Nevado del Ruiz?",
      "answer": "Nevado del Ruiz lies within Los Nevados National Natural Park, which is open to visitors, but summit access is frequently restricted due to ongoing volcanic activity. When the alert level is at Yellow (Level III) or above, the upper mountain and crater area are closed to all climbers and trekkers. Lower elevations of the park offer excellent páramo hiking, hot springs (Termales del Ruiz), and views of the snow-capped peak. Access is typically from Manizales via 4x4 vehicle. Always check the SGC alert status before planning any visit to the upper mountain."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was Armero not evacuated before the 1985 eruption?",
      "answer": "Despite over a year of volcanic warnings and a hazard map published weeks before the eruption that correctly identified Armero as at risk, the town was not effectively evacuated due to a combination of factors: conflicting government authority between local, regional, and national agencies; poor communication infrastructure (radio warnings were disrupted by the eruption itself); lack of public education about lahar hazards; economic pressures against evacuation; and a false sense of security from the volcano's long quiet period. The Armero tragedy became a global case study in disaster preparedness failure and led to sweeping reforms in volcanic risk management worldwide."
